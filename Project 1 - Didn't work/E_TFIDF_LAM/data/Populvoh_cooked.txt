in truth this account we shall now write under the law of god and christianity we shall bring it forth because there is no longer the means whereby the popol vuh may be seen the means of seeing clearly that had come from across the sea the account of our obscurity and the means of seeing life clearly as it is said the original book exists that was written anciently but its witnesses and those who ponder it hide their faces great is its performance and its account of the completion and germination of all the sky and earth its four corners and its four sides all then was measured and staked out into four divisions doubling over and stretching the measuring cords of the womb of sky and the womb of earth thus were established the four corners the four sides as it is said by the framer and the shaper the mother and the father of life and all creation the giver of breath and the giver of heart they who give birth and give heart to the light everlasting the child of light born of woman and the son of light born of man they who are compassionate and wise in all things all that exists in the sky and on the earth in the lakes and in the sea the primordial world this is the account of when all is still silent and placid all is silent and calm hushed and empty is the womb of the sky figure 8 alone lies the expanse of the sea along with the womb of all the sky the maya of the region consider lake atitl n to be the waters of creation from which all things emerged these then are the first words the first speech there is not yet one person one animal bird fish crab tree rock hollow canyon meadow or forest all alone the sky exists the face of the earth has not yet appeared alone lies the expanse of the sea along with the womb of all the sky there is not yet anything gathered together all is at rest nothing stirs all is languid at rest in the sky there is not yet anything standing erect only the expanse of the water only the tranquil sea lies alone there is not yet anything that might exist all lies placid and silent in the darkness in the night all alone are the framer and the shaper sovereign and quetzal serpent they who have borne children and they who have begotten sons luminous they are in the water wrapped in quetzal feathers and cotinga feathers thus they are called quetzal serpent in their essence they are great sages great possessors of knowledge thus surely there is the sky there is also heart of sky which is said to be the name of the god figure 9 luminous they are in the water wrapped in quetzal feathers and cotinga feathers thus they are called quetzal serpent serpent deity redrawn from a classic maya cylinder vessel ca 750 850 the creation of the earth then came his word heart of sky arrived here with sovereign and quetzal serpent in the darkness in the night he spoke with sovereign and quetzal serpent they talked together then they thought and they pondered they reached an accord bringing together their words and their thoughts then they gave birth heartening one another beneath the light they gave birth to humanity then they arranged for the germination and creation of the trees and the bushes the germination of all life and creation in the darkness and in the night by heart of sky who is called huracan first is thunderbolt huracan second is youngest thunderbolt and third is sudden thunderbolt these three together are heart of sky then they came together with sovereign and quetzal serpent together they conceived light and life how shall it be sown when shall there be a dawn for anyone who shall be a provider who shall be a sustainer then be it so you are conceived may the water be taken away emptied out so that the plate of the earth may be created may it be gathered and become level then may it be sown then may dawn the sky and the earth there can be no worship no reverence given by what we have framed and what we have shaped until humanity has been created until people have been made they said then the earth was created by them merely their word brought about the creation of it in order to create the earth they said earth and immediately it was created just like a cloud like a mist was the creation and formation of it then they called forth the mountains from the water straightaway the great mountains came to be it was merely their spirit essence their miraculous power that brought about the conception of the mountains and the valleys straightaway were created cypress groves and pine forests to cover the face of the earth figure 10 first the earth was created the mountains and the valleys the waterways were divided their branches coursing among the mountains highland stream near xetzak cunen thus quetzal serpent rejoiced it is good that you have come heart of sky you huracan and you as well youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt that which we have framed and shaped shall turn out well they said first the earth was created the mountains and the valleys the waterways were divided their branches coursing among the mountains thus the waters were divided revealing the great mountains for thus was the creation of the earth created then by heart of sky and heart of earth as they are called they were the first to conceive it the sky was set apart the earth also was set apart within the waters thus was conceived the successful completion of the work when they thought and when they pondered the creation of the animals then were conceived the animals of the mountains the guardians of the forest and all that populate the mountains the deer and the birds the puma and the jaguar the serpent and the rattlesnake the pit viper and the guardian of the bushes she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons then asked shall it be merely solitary merely silent beneath the trees and the bushes it is well that there shall be guardians for them they said thus they considered and spoke together and immediately were created the deer and the birds having done this they then provided homes for the deer and the birds you deer will sleep along the courses of rivers and in the canyons here you will be in the meadows and in the orchards in the forests you shall multiply you will walk on all fours and thus you will be able to stand they were told then they established the homes of the birds both small and great you birds you will make your homes and your houses in the tops of trees and in the tops of bushes there you will multiply and increase in numbers in the branches of the trees and the bushes the deer and the birds were told figure 11 you birds you will make your homes and your houses in the tops of trees and in the tops of bushes water bird redrawn from a classic maya ceramic plate when this had been done all of them received their places to sleep and their places to rest homes were provided for the animals on the earth by she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons thus all was completed for the deer and the birds the fall of the animals then it was said to the deer and the birds by the framer and the shaper she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons speak call don't moan or cry out speak to one another each according to your kind according to your group they were told the deer the birds the pumas the jaguars and the serpents speak therefore our names worship us for we are your mother and your father say this therefore huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt heart of sky and heart of earth framer and shaper she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons speak call upon us worship us they were told but they did not succeed they did not speak like people they only squawked and chattered and roared their speech was unrecognizable for each cried out in a different way when they heard this the framer and the shaper said their speech did not turn out well and again they said to each other they were not able to speak our names we are their framer and their shaper this is not good said she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons to each other they were therefore told you shall be replaced because you were not successful you could not speak we have therefore changed our word your food and your sustenance your sleeping places and your places to rest that which belonged to you shall be in the canyons and the forests nevertheless because you have not been able to worship us or call upon us there will yet be someone else who may be a worshiper we shall now make one who will give honor your calling will merely be to have your flesh eaten thus be it so this must be your service they were told thus were commanded the animals both small and great that were upon the face of the earth figure 12 your calling will merely be to have your flesh eaten deer marked for death with crossed bones redrawn from a maya ceramic vessel then they wanted to test again their fate they wanted to make another attempt they wanted to try again to arrange for those who would worship them the speech of the animals could not be understood because of the way they were made they were not successful therefore their flesh was brought low they were made to serve the animals that were on the face of the earth were eaten and killed the creation of the mud person thus there was another attempt to frame and shape man by the framer and the shaper by she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons let us try again before the first sowing before the dawn approaches let us make a provider a sustainer for us how shall we then be called upon so that we are remembered upon the face of the earth we have already made a first attempt with what we have framed and what we have shaped but we were not successful in being worshiped or in being revered by them thus let us try again to make one who will honor us who will respect us one who will be a provider and a sustainer they said then was the framing the making of it of earth and mud was its flesh composed but they saw that it was still not good it merely came undone and crumbled it merely became sodden and mushy it merely fell apart and dissolved its head was not set apart properly its face could only look in one direction its face was hidden neither could it look about at first it spoke but without knowledge straightaway it would merely dissolve in water for it was not strong figure 13 of earth and mud was its flesh composed but they saw that it was still not good it merely came undone and crumbled head of a classic maya lord san antonio museum of art then said the framer and the shaper we have made a mistake thus let this be merely a mistake it cannot walk neither can it multiply then let it be so let it be merely left behind as a thing of no importance they said therefore they undid it they toppled what they had framed what they had shaped then they said again how then will we truly make that which may succeed and bear fruit that will worship us and that will call upon us they asked then they thought again we shall merely tell xpiyacoc and xmucane hunahpu possum and hunahpu coyote try again a divination a shaping said the framer and the shaper to each other then they called upon xpiyacoc and xmucane and in this manner were the seers addressed grandmother of day grandmother of light in this way they were addressed by the framer and the shaper for these are the names of xpiyacoc and xmucane the creation of the effigies of carved wood huracan along with sovereign and quetzal serpent then spoke to the master of days and the mistress of shaping they who are seers it shall be found it shall be discovered how we are to create shaped and framed people who will be our providers and sustainers may we be called upon and may we be remembered for it is with words that we are sustained o midwife and patriarch our grandmother and our grandfather xpiyacoc and xmucane thus may it be spoken may it be sown may it dawn so that we are called upon and supported so that we are remembered by framed and shaped people by effigies and forms of people hearken and let it be so reveal your names hunahpu possum and hunahpu coyote great she who has borne children and great he who has begotten sons great peccary and great coati jeweler and worker in precious stones sculptor and wood worker creator of the green earth and creator of the blue sky incense maker and master artist grandmother of day and grandmother of light thus shall you all be called by that which we shall frame and shape cast grains of maize and tz'ite to divine how what we shall make will come out when we grind and chisel out its mouth and face in wood so it was said to the masters of days figure 14 thus began the divination ceremony the casting of grains of maize and of tz'ite the revelation of days and of shaping divination ceremony using grains of maize at chutinamit near santiago atitl n thus began the divination ceremony the casting of grains of maize and of tz'ite the revelation of days and of shaping then spoke the one grandmother and the one grandfather to them for this was the grandfather the master of the tz'ite xpiyacoc by name and this was the grandmother the mistress of days and mistress of shaping who is at the foot who is called xmucane thus they began to speak to carry out their divination ceremony may it be discovered may it be found say it our ears hear you speak tell it may the tree be found that is to be carved and chiseled out by the framer and the shaper if this is to be the provider and the sustainer then may it now be sown that the dawn may come you grains of maize and you tz'ite you days and you the shaping you are called you are summoned thus it was said to the grains of maize and the tz'ite to the days and the shaping bring it to a conclusion o heart of sky do not punish them further do not cause any more suffering for sovereign and quetzal serpent they said then they spoke straight to the point may these effigies of wood come out well may they speak may they communicate there upon the face of the earth may it be so they said and when they had spoken straightaway the effigies of carved wood were made they had the appearance of people and spoke like people as well they populated the whole face of the earth the effigies of carved wood began to multiply bearing daughters and sons figure 15 and when they had spoken straightaway the effigies of carved wood were made classic period wooden figure from tabasco metropolitan museum of art nevertheless they still did not possess their hearts nor their minds they did not remember their framer or their shaper they walked without purpose they crawled on their hands and knees and did not remember heart of sky thus they were weighed in the balance they were merely an experiment an attempt at people at first they spoke but their faces were all dried up their legs and arms were not filled out they had no blood or blood flow within them they had no sweat or oil their cheeks were dry and their faces were masks their legs and arms were stiff their bodies were rigid thus they were not capable of understanding before their framer and their shaper those who had given them birth and given them hearts they were the first numerous people who have lived here upon the face of the earth the fall of the effigies of carved wood then came the end of the effigies carved of wood for they were ruined crushed and killed a flood was planned by heart of sky that came down upon the heads of the effigies carved of wood figure 16 a flood was planned by heart of sky that came down upon the heads of the effigies carved of wood the destruction of the world by flood from the dresden codex p 74 villacorta and villacorta 1930 the body of man had been carved of tz'ite wood by the framer and the shaper the body of woman consisted of reeds according to the desire of the framer and the shaper but they were not capable of understanding and did not speak before their framer and their shaper their makers and their creators thus they were killed in the flood there came a great resin down from the sky there came the ones called chiselers of faces who gouged out their eyes there came death knives which cut off their heads there came crouching jaguar who ate their flesh there came striking jaguar who struck them they smashed their bones and their tendons their bones were ground up they were broken into pieces their faces were ground up because they proved to be incapable of understanding before the face of their mother and the face of their father heart of sky huracan by name thus they caused the face of the earth to be darkened and there fell a black rain a rain that fell both day and night the small and the great animals came in upon them their faces were crushed by the trees and the stones they were spoken to by all their maize grinders and their cooking griddles their plates and their pots their dogs and their grinding stones however many things they had all of them crushed their faces their dogs and their turkeys said to them pain you have caused us you ate us therefore it will be you that we will eat now then the grinding stones said this to them we were ground upon by you every day every day in the evening and at dawn always you did holi holi huki huki on our faces this was our service for you who were the first people but this day you shall feel our strength we shall grind you like maize we shall grind up your flesh said their grinding stones to them then their dogs said this to them why was it that you didn t give us our food all we did was look at you and you chased us away you threw us out you raised sticks against us to beat us while you ate thus you have spoken to us we could not speak therefore we received nothing from you how could you not have understood this you did understand we were forgotten because of you this day therefore you shall try the teeth that are in our mouths we shall eat you said the dogs to them thus their faces were crushed figure 17 this day therefore you shall try the teeth that are in our mouths we shall eat you said the dogs to them dog redrawn from a classic maya vase coe 1973 99 then spoke also their griddles and their pots to them pain you have caused us our mouths and our faces are sooty you were forever throwing us upon the fire and burning us although we felt no pain you now shall try it we shall burn you said all of their pots thus their faces were all crushed the stones of the hearth flattened them they would come out from the fire landing on their heads and causing them pain they fled they hurried away they wanted to climb up on top of the houses but the houses would fall apart beneath them and they were thrown off they wanted to climb up to the tops of the trees but the trees would not support them they wanted to hide in caves but the mouths of the caves closed up before their faces thus the framed people the shaped people were undone they were demolished and overthrown as people the mouths and the faces of all of them were ruined and crushed it is said that the spider monkeys that are in the forest today are descendents of these people this was their heritage because their flesh was merely wood when it was created by the framer and the shaper therefore the spider monkeys appear like people descendents of one generation of framed and shaped people but they were only effigies carved of wood figure 18 it is said that the spider monkeys that are in the forest today are descendents of these people spider monkeys at la venta park villahermosa the pride of seven macaw before the dawn while the face of the earth was only a little brightened before there was a sun there was one who puffed himself up named seven macaw there was a sky and an earth but the faces of the sun and moon were dim he therefore declared himself to be the bright sign for those who were drowned in the flood he was like an enchanted person in his essence figure 19 while the face of the earth was only a little brightened before there was a sun there was one who puffed himself up named seven macaw scarlet macaw guatemala i am great i dwell above the heads of the people who have been framed and shaped i am their sun i am also their light and i am also their moon then be it so great is my brightness by the brilliance of my silver and gold i light the walkways and pathways of the people my eyes sparkle with glittering blue green jewels my teeth as well are jade stones as brilliant as the face of the sky this my beak shines brightly far into the distance like the moon my throne is gold and silver when i go forth from my throne i brighten the face of the earth thus i am the sun i am the moon as well for those who are born in the light those who are begotten in the light then be it so my vision reaches far said seven macaw now seven macaw was not truly the sun but he puffed himself up in this way because of his plumage and his gold and his silver his vision did not reach beyond where he sat it did not really reach everywhere beneath the sky thus seven macaw puffed himself up in the days and months before the faces of the sun moon and stars could truly be seen he desired only greatness and transcendence before the light of the sun and moon were revealed in their clarity this was in the era when the flood was made because of the effigies of carved wood now we shall tell how seven macaw died how he was defeated at the time when people were made by the framer and the shaper the fall of seven macaw and his sons this is the beginning of his defeat this is the shaking of the day of seven macaw by the twins named hunahpu and xbalanque they were simply gods as a result they saw evil in this prideful one who acted according to his own desires before the face of heart of sky thus the boys said good shall never come of this people will never be able to live here on the face of the earth thus we will try to shoot him with our blowguns when he flies over his food we will shoot him thus causing him to be afflicted then his jade his gold and silver his jewels his glittering things and all things over which he keeps vigil will come to an end may it be done thus for people cannot be created where only gold and silver are glory then be it so said the boys and each one shouldered his blowgun now this seven macaw had two sons his firstborn was zipacna and his secondborn was cabracan chimalmat was the name of their mother the wife of seven macaw zipacna was he that sustained the great mountains chigag hunahpu peculya xcanul macamob and huliznab these are the names of the mountains that existed at the time of the dawn in a single night they were created by zipacna cabracan was he who would shake the mountains both small and great causing them to tremble but it was only the pride of the sons of seven macaw this is what i am i am the sun said seven macaw this is what i am i am the maker of the earth said zipacna and i am he who fells the sky and causes the earth to tumble down said cabracan now these the children of seven macaw received their greatness from their father the boys hunahpu and xbalanque therefore saw evil in them before the creation of our first mother and our first father thus the boys planned their deaths and their loss the defeat of seven macaw this then is the blowgun shooting of seven macaw by the twins we shall now tell the story of the defeat of each of the prideful ones this is seven macaw and a great nance tree this then is the food of seven macaw each day he would rise up to the top of the tree to knock down some of the fruit of the nance tree and it is there that he was seen by hunahpu and xbalanque the twins watched for him beneath the tree hidden in its leaves at length seven macaw perched on the nance tree to feed and was shot by them hunahpu directed a pellet straight from his blowgun into his jaw seven macaw cried out sailing over the top of the tree and landing on the ground figure 20 at length seven macaw perched on the nance tree to feed and was shot by them bird deity being shot by twins with blowguns redrawn from an early classic maya plate quickly hunahpu ran out to grab him but instead seven macaw tore off the arm of hunahpu he wrenched it back bending it back at the shoulder until it was torn free from hunahpu still it was good what they did this first episode will not result in their defeat by seven macaw even though he took away the arm of hunahpu so then seven macaw went to his home holding his jaw in his palms what have you got there asked chimalmat the wife of seven macaw what is it two demons shot me my jaw was dislocated by them and now my teeth torment me with pain this i have brought to hang over the fire it will dangle over the fire until they come to take it back again truly they are demons said seven macaw as he hung the arm of hunahpu then hunahpu and xbalanque planned again they went to speak to the one grandfather whose hair was now truly white and also the one grandmother who was now truly humble they were people who now walked bent over with age great white peccary was the name of the grandfather and great white coati was the name of the grandmother the boys then spoke to the grandmother and the grandfather we would like you to accompany us to retrieve our arm from seven macaw we will just follow along behind you you will say to him suffer these our grandsons that accompany us their mother and father are dead thus they follow along there behind us we provide for them by removing worms from teeth which is our profession thus seven macaw will see us merely as children even while we are giving you our instructions said the twins very well they said thus they came to where seven macaw was seated on the edge of his throne the grandmother and the grandfather passed below the home of the lord while the twins played behind them now seven macaw was crying out because of his teeth when he saw the grandfather and grandmother journeying together he asked them from where do you come our grandfather he asked we are just making a living thou lord they replied how do you make your living are not those your children that accompany you they are not thou lord these are our grandsons but surely we take pity on them and give them a portion we give them our scraps thou lord said the grandmother and the grandfather the lord was by then nearly finished off because of the pain in his teeth therefore it was with great effort that he spoke again i beg of you take pity on me what medicines would you make with what medicines would you cure asked the lord we would merely remove worms from teeth cure eye ailments and set bones thou lord they replied very well cure then my teeth for truly they ache constantly and i can no longer bear it i cannot sleep because of them and the same goes for my eyes two demons shot me with a blowgun and since then i have not been able to eat because of it thus take pity on me for my jaw and my teeth cause me anguish very well thou lord it is a worm that causes the pain we will merely replace them thy teeth will have to come out it is perhaps not a good thing that my teeth come out for it is only because of them that i am lord my teeth along with my eyes are my finery we shall replace them then with this ground bone but instead of ground bone they were mere white grains of maize that were to be placed very well then take them out help me he said therefore so then the teeth of seven macaw were taken out as a substitute they placed mere white grains of maize mere shiny white grains of maize and immediately his face fell no longer did he appear as a lord at length all of the brilliant blue green jewels in his mouth were removed then the eyes of seven macaw were treated his eyes were plucked thus completely removing the precious metal from them he surely felt no pain he just stared instead thus the basis for his pride was completely taken away according to the plans of hunahpu and xbalanque when at length seven macaw died hunahpu retrieved his arm then also chimalmat died the wife of seven macaw thus the wealth of seven macaw was lost for the healers took it away the jewels the precious stones and all that which had made him proud here upon the face of the earth it was truly the enchanted grandmother and the enchanted grandfather that did it then the boys retrieved their arm and implanted it back into its socket making it whole again they had desired the death of seven macaw and they were able to do it for they saw pride as evil and went to do these things according to the word of heart of sky the deeds of zipacna and the four hundred boys these now are the deeds of zipacna the firstborn son of seven macaw i am the maker of mountains said zipacna now this zipacna was bathing on the banks of a river when there passed by four hundred boys dragging a tree to be used as a supporting beam for their hut these four hundred were walking along having cut down a great tree for a lintel figure 21 these four hundred were walking along having cut down a great tree for its lintel interior of maler s palace tikal note the wooden lintel in the doorway and the supporting beams in the corbelled vault zipacna therefore came to the four hundred boys and asked them what are you doing boys it s just this tree we cannot lift it to our shoulders to carry it i will carry it on my shoulders where does it go what use does it have in your hearts it is to be the lintel for our hut very well he said therefore thus he carried it on his shoulders up to the doorway of the hut of the four hundred boys stay with us boy do you have a mother or a father there is no one he replied surely we beseech you then to help us for tomorrow another tree will be raised as a supporting beam for our hut fine he said again then the four hundred boys made their plans this boy what will we do to him we will kill him for it is not good what he does just lifting the tree all by himself let us therefore dig a great hole and then we shall abandon him there we will say to him go dig out the earth from the bottom of the hole and when he is bent over down there in the hole we will hurl down the great tree and thus he will die there in the hole said the four hundred boys and so they dug a great hole that went down very deep then they sent for zipacna we entrust you to go now to dig in the ground for we are not able to do it he was told very well he replied thus he went down into the hole call when you have finished digging up the earth for you must go down deep he was told fine he replied then he began to dig in the hole but this hole was to be his own salvation he had learned that he was to be killed and therefore he had dug a branching hole to one side it was in this secondary hole that he was saved how far are you into it he was asked by the four hundred boys i am digging it quickly when i shall call up to you there then the digging will have been successfully completed called zipacna from the hole but he did not dig his own tomb there at the bottom of the hole rather he dug the means for his own salvation therefore when zipacna called up he had already saved himself there inside the hole come and take the earth away the dirt that i have dug up from the hole truly deep have i dug down can you not hear my call your voices just echo away as if you were a long way off when i hear them said zipacna from his hole thus he was already sheltered when he called up from inside the hole the boys then dragged over the great tree and hurled it down into the hole he is no more he does not speak when he cries out we will know that he shall be dead they whispered to each other for they each hid their purpose when they hurled down the tree so when he spoke he cried out with a loud voice he called out one more word when they dropped down the tree aha we have succeeded truly good we have done it to him he died what kind of omen would it have been if he had persisted in carrying out his deeds his work then he might have become first among us placing himself over us even us the four hundred boys they said and so they rejoiced for three days we will merely make sweet drink and when three days have passed we will drink to our dwelling to our hut even us the four hundred boys they said tomorrow and the next day we will see if ants don t come forth from the ground when he begins to stink and decompose then will our hearts be comforted when we will drink our sweet drink they said but zipacna heard this down there in the hole when they said this and on the second day the ants assembled themselves they walked about they swarmed beneath the tree everywhere they carried in their teeth the hair as well as the nails of zipacna now when the boys saw this they said to each other the demon is finished look at the ants they have gathered together they have assembled here and everywhere they carry his hair in their teeth surely they can be seen carrying his nails we have done it at last they said to each other but zipacna was still alive he had merely cut the hair off his own head and gnawed off his own nails to give to the ants thus the four hundred boys thought that he had died on the third day they started in on their sweet drink all the boys became drunk all four hundred boys thus were drunk and didn t feel anything when zipacna collapsed their hut down upon their heads as a result all of them were finished struck down every one of them not even one or two of the four hundred boys were saved such was the death of these four hundred boys at the hands of zipacna the son of seven macaw it is said that they became the constellation known as the pleiades but perhaps this is merely a fable now we will tell the story of the defeat of zipacna by the twins hunahpu and xbalanque the defeat of zipacna this now is the overthrow and death of zipacna he was defeated by the twins hunahpu and xbalanque whose hearts were offended by the deaths of the four hundred boys at the hands of zipacna now this zipacna would spend each day wandering in search of his food only fish and crabs which he looked for in the rivers by night however he would carry mountains on his back thus hunahpu and xbalanque transformed for him a great crab for this purpose they used a bromelia flower the kind of bromeliad that may be picked in the forests to make the open claws for its shell and backside they used a hollowed out stone this shell they placed at the bottom of a cave below a great mountain meauan was the name of this mountain where he was defeated figure 22 thus hunahpu and xbalanque transformed for him a great crab for this purpose they used a bromelia flower the kind of bromeliad that may be picked in the forests to make the open claws when the boys came they found zipacna by the river where are you going boy they asked zipacna i m not going anywhere i m just searching for my food replied zipacna what is your food only fish and crabs but i haven t found any yet it has been two days since i have eaten and now i cannot bear the hunger said zipacna to hunahpu and xbalanque there is a crab there below the canyon it is truly a great crab why don t you try your luck with it asked hunahpu and xbalanque perhaps you will be able to eat it it merely bit us when we tried to catch it so we are afraid of it but he will not go away and you could catch it take pity on me guide me there boys said zipacna we do not want to just go along yourself there is no way that you will get lost if you just follow the course of the river until you reach the base of the great mountain there it will be situated below the canyon just go along over there said hunahpu and xbalanque please take pity on me i will never find it boys you go first as my guides i know where there are many birds that you could shoot with your blowguns said zipacna he humbled himself before them promising to reward them he wept before them perhaps you will not be able to catch it then you would return like we did because not only were we not able to eat it but it would straightaway bite us we went in there headfirst on our stomachs but it became frightened a little later we went in lying on our backs but we couldn t find it again thus it would be good if you went in lying on your back he was told very well replied zipacna thus they left accompanied by zipacna at length they arrived below the canyon where the crab was placed its surface bright red there at the base of the canyon this was their deception that s good rejoiced zipacna he wanted to put it straight in his mouth because he was truly famished and wanted to eat it he just wanted to go in headfirst on his stomach but the crab climbed high up and zipacna came back out didn t you get it he was asked no it climbed high up and after awhile i couldn t find it again perhaps it would be good then if i went in again lying on my back he said therefore then he went back in again lying on his back he went all the way in until only his kneecaps showed outside thus he was completely swallowed up the mountain then settled down onto his chest so that he could not turn over again zipacna became stone thus was the defeat of zipacna at the hands of the boys hunahpu and xbalanque figure 23 the mountain then settled down onto his chest so that he could not turn over again zipacna became stone stucco crocodile comalcalco such is the ancient account of the first son of seven macaw the maker of mountains as he was called who was defeated beneath the mountain called meauan it was merely enchantment by which this second prideful one was defeated now we shall tell the tale of another the defeat of cabracan the third prideful one was the second son of seven macaw cabracan by name i am the wrecker of mountains said he it was simply because of hunahpu and xbalanque that cabracan was defeated then huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt spoke to hunahpu and xbalanque saying according to my word the second son of seven macaw must also be defeated for it is not good what they have done upon the earth they surpass the sun in greatness and importance and this is not as it should be thus lure him away there to the east where the sun rises said huracan to the twins very well thou lord it has always been thus that we do not approve of him for he is not lifted up where thou art thou heart of sky the boys replied when they received the word of huracan now this cabracan occupied himself as a wrecker of mountains he would simply tap his foot a little on the surface of the earth and straightaway mountains both small and great would tumble down then he was met by the twins where are you going boy they asked cabracan i m not going anywhere i am merely a feller of mountains i will wreck them as long as there is sun and light he said when he spoke to them figure 24 i am merely a feller of mountains i will wreck them as long as there is sun and light all of the mountains mentioned in the text were volcanoes like this one volc n san pedro near santiago atitl n then cabracan spoke again to hunahpu and xbalanque where have you come from i do not know your faces what are your names asked cabracan we have no names we have just been blowgunning and trapping in the mountains we are just poor orphans for there is nothing that is ours boy we just wander in the mountains both small and great there is one great mountain that we saw that keeps growing until truly high it ascends it simply rises up far above the peaks of all the mountains we could not catch even one or two birds before its face is it really true that you fell all mountains boy asked hunahpu and xbalanque of cabracan is it true that you saw this mountain of which you speak where is it you shall surely see that i will fell it where did you see it there it is in the east where the sun rises said hunahpu and xbalanque good you lead the way the twins were told no you just take the middle place between us one on your left and one on your right hand we have our blowguns and if there are any birds we will shoot them they said they rejoiced that they could practice their shooting but there were no clay pellets in their blowguns when they shot them they merely blew at the birds thus cabracan was amazed then the boys used a twist drill to make their fire upon which they roasted the birds they covered the skin of one of the birds with quicklime until it was coated with white earth we will give this to him when he becomes ravenous with hunger when he savors the aroma of our birds he will be defeated we will put earth on its skin we will cook it in earth in the same way therefore he himself will be buried in the earth this must be if the great sage the one to be framed and shaped is to be sown and to have his dawn the boys said cabracan shall desire with all his heart to eat what we will cook this shall be the desire of the heart of cabracan said hunahpu and xbalanque to each other then they roasted the birds until they had been cooked to a golden brown they would drip with fat from their skins and give off a fragrant aroma thus cabracan desired to be fed his mouth watered he just gulped and drooled saliva and spittle because of the fragrance of the birds thus he begged of them what is it that you are eating its aroma is truly delicious to smell give me a little he said therefore then they gave to cabracan a bird and this was his defeat when he had finished the bird they went on their way again until they arrived in the east there they came to the great mountain but by now the legs and arms of cabracan had become weak never again would he be strong because of the earth coated on the skin of the bird he had eaten he could no longer do anything to the mountains he did not succeed in causing them to fall apart then the boys tied him up they tied his hands behind his back the boys were mindful to make sure that his hands were well bound they also tied his ankles together then they hurled him down into the earth and buried him thus cabracan was defeated at the hands of hunahpu and xbalanque innumerable were their deeds here on the face of the earth now we shall tell of the birth of hunahpu and xbalanque having first given the account of the defeat of seven macaw along with zipacna and cabracan here upon the earth the tale of the father of hunahpu and xbalanque we shall now name the name of the father of hunahpu and xbalanque we shall retell it we shall merely repeat the tale the account of the engendering of hunahpu and xbalanque but we shall tell only the half of it the smallest part of the tale of their father the deeds of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu above xibalba this therefore is the account of they whose names are one hunahpu and seven hunahpu for thus they are called it was in the darkness in the night when one hunahpu and seven hunahpu were born to xpiyacoc and xmucane now this one hunahpu had two children both sons one batz was the name of his firstborn and one chouen was the name of his secondborn the name of their mother was xbaquiyalo thus she was called the wife of one hunahpu but seven hunahpu had no wife he was merely a companion merely secondary by his nature he was like a servant to one hunahpu they were great thinkers for great was their knowledge they were seers here upon the face of the earth they were good by their nature and in their birth as well they revealed their talents to one batz and one chouen the sons of one hunahpu thus one batz and one chouen became flautists and singers writers and sculptors jade workers and precious metalsmiths as for one hunahpu and seven hunahpu they would merely play dice and ball everyday the four of them would pair off to oppose each other figure 25 as for one hunahpu and seven hunahpu they would merely play dice and ball everyday the four of them would pair off to oppose each other ballgame scene from a classic maya vase rollout photograph justin kerr 1997 file no 2022 when they gathered together to play in the ballcourt the falcon would arrive to watch over them this falcon was the messenger of huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt the face of the earth was not far for him nor was xibalba far for him in an instant he could return again to the sky with huracan thus they tarried here upon the earth by then the mother of one batz and one chouen had died now it was on the path leading to xibalba where they played ball thus the lords of xibalba one death and seven death heard them figure 26 now it was on the path leading to xibalba where they played ball ancient ballcourt at copan what is happening on the surface of the earth they are just stomping about and shouting may they be summoned here therefore they shall come to play ball and we shall defeat them they have simply failed to honor us they have neither honor nor respect certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads said therefore all those of xibalba then they whose names were one death and seven death gathered all of their thoughts these therefore were the great judges all of them lords each was given his task and his dominion by one death and seven death figure 27 these therefore were the great judges all of them lords each was given his task and his dominion by one death and seven death view of the gods in the darkness of the underworld at the time of first creation from a classic maya vase drawing from coe 1973 109 these are the lords named flying scab and gathered blood their task is to sicken people in their blood these then are the lords pus demon and jaundice demon their dominion is to swell people up until pus oozes from the skin of their legs and the skin of their faces becomes yellow with jaundice as it is said thus this is the dominion of pus demon and jaundice demon these then are the lords bone staff and skull staff the staff bearers of xibalba their staffs are mere bones these staff bearers are they who skeletize people until they are truly bones and skulls as a result they would die having received only emaciated bones bloated with starvation these are they whose names are bone staff and skull staff figure 28 these then are the lords bone staff and skull staff the staff bearers of xibalba their staffs are mere bones death god bearing a staff redrawn from a classic maya vase these then are the lords whose names are sweepings demon and stabbings demon their task is simply to overtake people if they abandon sweepings and trash in back or in front of their houses these would be overtaken and stabbed by them until they fall face down upon the earth and die this therefore is the dominion of sweepings demon and stabbings demon as they are called these then are they whose names are lord wing and packstrap their dominion is the people who die on the road as a result of sudden death as it is called blood would come to their mouths and they would die vomiting blood each one has his task the burden he carries on his shoulders they would simply wear out the necks and the hearts of these people so that they die on the road they would cause this to happen outside when people go out walking they would come upon them this then is the dominion of wing and packstrap figure 29 each one has his task the burden he carries on his shoulders they would simply wear out the necks and the hearts of these people so that they die on the road deity wearing a packstrap from copan stela d drawing by linda schele these therefore gathered together their thoughts when one hunahpu and seven hunahpu were persecuted and harassed for the xibalbans desired the gaming things of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu their leathers their yokes their arm protectors their headdresses and their face masks the finery of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu now we shall tell of their journey to xibalba one batz and one chouen the sons of one hunahpu remained behind their mother had died later one batz and one chouen will be defeated by hunahpu and xbalanque the summons of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu to xibalba then was the arrival of the messengers of one death and seven death go you war councilors to summon one hunahpu and seven hunahpu tell them when you arrive thus say the lords they must come say the lords to you they must come here to play ball with us that we may be invigorated by them truly we are amazed greatly at them thus they must come say the lords may they bring hither their implements their yokes their arm protectors and their rubber ball as well thus say the lords tell them when you arrive there the messengers were told these messengers were the owls arrow owl one leg owl macaw owl and skull owl for so the messengers of xibalba were called this arrow owl was like the arrow piercing this one leg owl merely had one leg but there were his wings this macaw owl had a red back and there were also his wings now this skull owl only had a skull with no legs there were merely wings the burden of these four messengers was to be the war councilors thus they arrived there from xibalba they arrived suddenly perching atop the ballcourt one hunahpu and seven hunahpu were playing ball at the court that was called honor and respect at carchah when they came the owls therefore alighted atop the ballcourt where they delivered in order the words of one death and seven death pus demon and jaundice demon bone staff and skull staff flying scab and gathered blood sweepings demon and stabbings demon wing and packstrap for these are the names of all the lords thus the owls repeated their words figure 30 the owls therefore alighted atop the ballcourt where they delivered in order the words of one death and seven death death owl redrawn from a classic maya vase are these not the words of the lords one death and seven death those are the words that they said replied the owls we shall surely be your companions you shall bring all the gaming things say the lords very well but wait for us while we leave instructions behind with our mother they said thus they went to their home to speak to their mother for their father had died we must surely go our mother the messengers of the lord have just arrived to take us they must come we were told thus the summoners have spoken but this our rubber ball shall remain behind they said then they went to tie it up above the house we will surely return to use it again until then merely play the flute and sing write and carve in this way one batz and one chouen were instructed thus you shall warm our home and you shall warm the heart of your grandmother but their mother xmucane wept bitterly we must go but we will not die do not grieve said one hunahpu and seven hunahpu as they left the descent of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu into xibalba then went one hunahpu and seven hunahpu guided by the messengers as they descended along the path to xibalba they went down steep steps until they came out again upon the banks of turbulent river canyons trembling canyon and murmuring canyon were the names of the canyons that they passed through they also passed through turbulent rivers they passed through scorpion river where there were innumerable scorpions but they were not stung then they arrived at blood river they were able to pass through it because they did not drink from it then they arrived at pus river which was nothing but a river of pus neither were they defeated here but simply passed through it as well at length they arrived at a crossroads and it was here at the four crossing roads that they were defeated one was red road and another was black road white road was one while another was yellow road thus there were four roads now this the black road said me take me for i am the lord s road thus spoke the road but it was there that they were defeated they started then on the road to xibalba at last they arrived at the council place of the lords of xibalba and there again they were defeated they who were seated first in order were mere effigies of carved wood adorned by the xibalbans it was these then that they greeted morning one death they said to the first effigy morning seven death they said again to the carved wood thus they did not prevail instead the lords of xibalba roared with laughter they merely roared with laughter all the lords because they had completely prevailed in their hearts they had defeated one hunahpu and seven hunahpu and after they had laughed one death and seven death spoke it is good that you have come tomorrow you shall put to use your yokes and your arm protectors they were told sit down on our bench they were told but the bench that they were offered was nothing but a very hot stone and they were burned when they sat on it truly they spun around on top of it neither did they find relief truly they leaped up when their seats were burned thus the xibalbans laughed again they laughed until their insides hurt and their chests became cramped from their laughter all the lords of xibalba grabbed themselves and rolled around in their laughter now just go to the house someone will come to deliver your torch and your cigars there at the sleeping place they were told thus they arrived in the house of darkness there was nothing but darkness inside that house then the xibalbans gathered their thoughts tomorrow we will merely sacrifice them they only have to make a mistake and straightaway they will die by means of our gaming things that we use to play ball said the xibalbans to each other for their ball was merely a round blade white dagger was the name of the ball of xibalba their ball was sharp shattered bones pierced through the ball of xibalba thus one hunahpu and seven hunahpu entered into the house of darkness at length one came to give them their torch which was already lit it had been sent by one death and seven death along with cigars for each of them which had also already been lit these then were sent by the lords to one hunahpu and seven hunahpu they were seated cross legged there in the darkness when the courier arrived to give to them their torch and their cigars the torch was brightly burning when it arrived and with it were lit each one of the cigars these are to be returned at dawn they are not to be used up instead they are to be collected again intact thus say the lords to you they were told therefore they were defeated for they used up the torch as well as the cigars that had been given to them figure 31 therefore they were defeated for they used up the torch as well as the cigars that had been given to them individual smoking a cigar from madrid codex p 86b villacorta and villacorta 1930 xibalba is crowded with trials for there are many kinds of trials there the first of these is the house of darkness where nothing but darkness exists within the second is named shivering house for its interior is thick with frost a howling wind clatters there an icy wind whistles through its interior the third is named jaguar house where there are nothing but jaguars inside they bare their teeth crowding one another gnashing and snapping their teeth together they are captive jaguars within the house the fourth trial is named bat house for there are none but bats inside in this house they squeak they shriek as they fly about in the house for they are captive bats and cannot come out the fifth then is named blade house for there are only blades inside row upon row of alternating blades that would clash and clatter there in the house thus there are many trials in xibalba one hunahpu and seven hunahpu did not enter into them these are merely the names of each of the houses of trial thus one hunahpu and seven hunahpu came out and appeared before one death and seven death where are my cigars and my torch that were given to you last night they were asked we finished them off o lord very well then now your day is at an end you are to die thus they were lost they were broken as well here your faces shall be hidden for you are to be sacrificed said one death and seven death then they were sacrificed and buried it was at the place named crushing ballcourt that they were buried the head of one hunahpu was cut off while the rest of his body was buried with his younger brother figure 32 the head of one hunahpu was cut off while the rest of his body was buried with his younger brother on the left is a sacrifice by beheading in the court of an underworld lord from a classic maya vase coe 1973 92 place his head in the midst of the tree that is planted by the road said one death and seven death now when they went to place his head in the midst of the tree the tree bore fruit the tree had never borne fruit until the head of one hunahpu was placed in it this was the tree that we now call the calabash it is said to be the head of one hunahpu figure 33 now when they went to place his head in the midst of the tree the tree bore fruit the tree had never borne fruit until the head of one hunahpu was placed in it fruitful tree from the panel of the foliated cross palenque drawing by linda schele one death and seven death marveled at the fruit of the tree for its round fruit was everywhere neither could the head of one hunahpu be seen clearly for his face had become identical in appearance with the calabashes this was seen by all xibalba when they came to look at it in their hearts they perceived the greatness of the essence of that tree for it was accomplished immediately when the head of one hunahpu entered into its midst thus the xibalbans spoke one to another let no one cut the fruit nor enter beneath the tree they said thus they restricted themselves all the xibalbans restrained themselves for the head of one hunahpu was no longer clear having become identical with the fruit of the tree whose name is the calabash great is the account of it now a maiden heard of it thus we shall now tell of her arrival there the maiden lady blood and the tree of one hunahpu this therefore is the account of a maiden the daughter of the lord named gathered blood figure 34 a maiden the daughter of a lord had heard of it classic maya figurine of a noblewoman national museum of anthropology mexico city a maiden the daughter of a lord had heard of it gathered blood was the name of her father while the name of the maiden was lady blood when she heard the account of the fruit of the tree as told by her father she was amazed by the tale can i not come to know it by seeing the tree that has been spoken of i hear that its fruit is truly delicious she said thus she went alone beneath the tree that was planted at crushing ballcourt ah what is the fruit of this tree is not the fruit borne by this tree delicious i would not die i would not be lost would it be heard if i were to pick one asked the maiden then spoke the skull there in the midst of the tree what is it that you desire of this it is merely a skull a round thing placed in the branches of trees said the head of hunahpu when it spoke to the maiden you do not desire it she was told but i do desire it said the maiden very well then stretch out hither your right hand so that i may see it said the skull very well said the maiden and so she stretched upward her right hand before the face of the skull then the skull squeezed out some of its saliva directed toward the hand of the maiden when she saw this she immediately examined her hand but the saliva from the skull was not in her hand my saliva my spittle is merely a sign that i have given to you this head of mine no longer functions for it is merely a skull that cannot work the head of a truly great lord has good flesh upon his face but when he dies the people become frightened because of his bones in like manner his son is like his saliva his spittle he is his essence if his son becomes a lord or a sage or a master of speech then nothing will have been lost he will go on and once more become complete the face of the lord will not be extinguished nor will it be ruined the warrior the sage the master of speech will remain in the form of his daughters and his sons thus may it be so as i have done to you climb therefore up there to the face of the earth you will not die for you have entered into a promise thus be it so said the skull of one hunahpu and seven hunahpu now in this they merely carried out the thoughts and words of huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt thus the maiden returned again to her home having been given many instructions straightaway her children were created in her womb by the mere saliva thus was the creation of hunahpu and xbalanque now when the maiden had arrived at her home and six moons were completed she was noticed by her father gathered blood by name the ascent of lady blood from xibalba then the maiden was discovered by her father for he saw that she was now with child thus all the lords one death and seven death along with gathered blood gathered their thoughts this my daughter is with child o lords it is merely the result of her fornication said gathered blood when he met with the lords very well then question her about this and when she doesn t tell she will be sacrificed she will go far away to be sacrificed very well ye lords he replied he therefore questioned his daughter who is responsible for the child that is in your womb my daughter he asked i have no child my father she replied i have not known the face of any man very well then it is true that you are a fornicator sacrifice her you war councilors the four owls were told then bring back her heart inside a bowl so that the lords may examine it this day and so they went carrying the bowl and lifting up the maiden in their talons they took with them the white dagger the instrument of her sacrifice figure 35 and so they went carrying the bowl and lifting up the maiden in their talons woman borne by an underworld owl from the dresden codex p 17b villacorta and villacorta 1930 you will not succeed in killing me you messengers for this that is in my womb was merely created and is not the result of fornication rather it is the result of my admiration for the head of one hunahpu which is at crushing ballcourt thus do not sacrifice me you messengers said the maiden when she spoke but what shall we give as a substitute for your heart for we were told by your father bring hither her heart so that the lords may examine it and be satisfied with its form bring hither the bowl quickly and place her heart inside it were we not told this therefore what will we put in the bowl for above all else we do not want you to die said the messengers very well the heart will not be theirs at the same time your homes will no longer be here no longer will you lure people by force to their deaths only the true fornicator will be subject to one death and seven death mere croton tree sap will be theirs henceforth thus be it so it will be this that you shall burn before their faces it will not be this the heart that you will burn before their faces thus be it so take what the tree produces said the maiden then the red secretions of the tree were collected in the bowl there it congealed and became round the red tree therefore oozed forth the substitute for her heart the sap of the red tree was thus like blood when it came out it was the substitute for her blood thus she collected the sap the secretion of the red tree its surface became like bright red blood in the bowl when the maiden cut open the tree called the sacrifice red tree she named this blood and blood croton it is still called there on the face of the earth you will be esteemed for it is become yours she said therefore to the owls very well then you maiden we shall go then upward to hide you but first we shall give the substitute for your heart before the faces of the lords said the messengers and so they arrived before the faces of the lords who were all awaiting them expectantly was it not successful asked one death it was successful o lords this is surely her heart here in the bottom of the bowl very well i would see it therefore said one death then he lifted it up with his fingers dripping with blood from its surface it was bright red with blood stir well the face of the fire and place it over the fire said one death then they dried it over the fire while the xibalbans savored its fragrance they all rose up to lean over it for truly delicious was the smell of the blood to them now while they were bent over the owls went to guide the maiden up to the hole leading above the earth then the guides returned back down again thus the lords of xibalba were defeated for the maiden had tricked them all lady blood and the miracle of the maize this therefore is the mother of one batz and one chouen then arrived the woman lady blood by name who came to the mother of one batz and one chouen her children were still in her womb however it wasn t long before the birth of hunahpu and xbalanque so then the woman came to the grandmother she said to the grandmother figure 36 so then the woman came to the grandmother grandmother goddess goddess o redrawn from a classic maya vase taube 1992 fig 51c i have come thou lady she said when she arrived there with the grandmother i am thy daughter in law and thy child thou lady from where have you come do my children yet exist did they not die in xibalba only these two are left as their sign and their word one batz and one chouen are their names if you see that you have come go back the same way the maiden was told by the grandmother but it is true that i am thy daughter in law these are surely his these that i am carrying belong to one hunahpu one hunahpu and seven hunahpu are alive they are not dead that which they have done is merely a manifestation of their light thou mother in law thus you shall see it you shall see his face in these that i am carrying she told the grandmother now one batz and one chouen gloried in these things only the flute and song did they do only writing and carving was their work every day and so they comforted the heart of the grandmother thus the grandmother spoke to her i do not want you you are not my daughter in law it is merely the result of your fornication that is in your womb you are a deceiver my children that you spoke of have died the grandmother said again they are truly his i say to you very well then i hear you that you are my daughter in law the maiden was told go then to get food that these may eat go and harvest a great netful of maize and return with it then you will surely be my daughter in law just as you have said very well she replied then she went to the maizefield that belonged to one batz and one chouen along the path that had been cleared by them the maiden thus started out and arrived there at the maizefield but there was only a single ear of maize in the field there was not even one or two or three more although there was maize there it was but a single ear that had been produced figure 37 but there was only a single ear of maize in the field there was not even one or two or three more maize plant from chutinamit near santiago atitl n then the heart of the maiden sank see i am a sinner i am a debtor where shall i obtain the netful of food that is asked for she asked thus she called upon the guardians of the food come arise come stand up lady of the day toh and lady of the day canil lady cacao and lady of the day tzi you the guardians of the food of one batz and one chouen said the maiden then she took hold of the cornsilk the cornsilk atop the ear of ripe maize and pulled it upward she did not pick the ear of maize but it multiplied there in the net until the great net overflowed then when the maiden returned the animals carried the net for her as she returned but when she arrived and saw her grandmother they gave back her pack frame and she perspired as if she had carried it now when the grandmother saw the food the great netful she said where did you come by this food from where was it stolen i will surely go to see if you have finished off the maize plant and brought it all here said the grandmother thus she went to see the maize plant but there was the single ear of maize still on the maize plant and it was clear where the net had been placed beneath it the grandmother thus rushed back to her home and said to the maiden this is but a sign that you are in truth my daughter in law i will surely watch your deeds for they that are to be my grandchildren are enchanted already the maiden was told hunahpu and xbalanque in the house of the grandmother now we shall relate the tale of the birth of hunahpu and xbalanque this therefore is the account of their birth that we shall tell when the day arrived the maiden lady blood gave birth the grandmother did not see it when they were born for these two arose suddenly hunahpu and xbalanque were their names they arose in the mountains but when they were taken into the house they did not sleep take them away and abandon them for truly shrill are their mouths said the grandmother thus they were placed on an anthill and there they slept blissfully then they were taken out again and placed on a thornbush this was done by one batz and one chouen for they would have had them die there on the anthill and on the thornbush they wanted this because of the treachery and jealousy of one batz and one chouen thus at first their younger brothers were not accepted in the house they were not known therefore they just grew up in the mountains figure 38 thus at first their younger brothers were not accepted in the house therefore they just grew up in the mountains twin youthful deities redrawn from a classic maya vase taube 1992 fig 58c now one batz and one chouen were great flautists and singers they had grown in greatness they had passed through great affliction and misfortune and thus they had become great they were sages they were not only flautists and singers but they had also become writers and carvers everything they did was successful for them for they knew of the circumstances of their birth and certainly they were ingenious they were the substitutes for their father who had gone to xibalba and had died thus one batz and one chouen were great sages in their hearts they knew everything from the first even before their younger brothers were created but nothing ever came of these enchanted abilities because of their envy the abuses born in their hearts merely fell upon their own backs and nothing came of them thus they were ignored by hunahpu and xbalanque who went out every day to hunt with their blowguns they were not loved by their grandmother nor by one batz and one chouen nor were they given any food when meals were prepared for them one batz and one chouen would eat it all before they returned but they did not become enraged or angry they tolerated it for they knew their own nature and this was a light by which they could see thus when they returned each day one batz and one chouen would take away their birds and eat them they did not give anything to the twins hunahpu and xbalanque one batz and one chouen merely played the flute and sang then one day hunahpu and xbalanque returned without bringing any birds the grandmother was enraged because of this what is the reason that you have not brought any more birds hunahpu and xbalanque were asked this is why our grandmother our birds are just stuck up in the top of the tree they said there is no way to climb to the top of the tree to reach them our grandmother therefore we would like our older brothers to go with us to bring down the birds they said very well said their older brothers we will go with you at dawn thus they were defeated the two of them had planned for the defeat of one batz and one chouen we shall merely overturn their nature this is the essence of our words thus be it so for great is the affliction that they have caused us if it had been according to their desires we their younger brothers would have died and been lost in their hearts we are looked upon as slaves as if we worked for them instead we shall make of them an example they said one to another thus they went there below the tree whose name is yellow tree in company with their older brothers as they went they began to shoot with their blowguns for there were innumerable birds in the top of the tree singing riotously their older brothers marvelled at this when they saw the birds but not one of these birds that they saw fell down beneath the tree figure 39 as they went they began to shoot with their blowguns for there were innumerable birds in the top of the tree singing riotously twin deities hunting birds with their blowguns from a classic maya vase rollout photograph justin kerr 1989 file no 4151 our birds do not fall down here just go and bring them down they said to their older brothers very well they said and they climbed up to the top of the tree but the tree began to grow larger it swelled in size thus when they wanted to come back down one batz and one chouen couldn t climb down from the top of the tree they therefore called down from the top of the tree what can we say our younger brothers take pity on us this tree is truly frightening to see our younger brothers they called down from the top of the tree thus hunahpu and xbalanque called back to them loosen your loincloths and retie the long end below your bellies pull out the tail end behind you then you will be able to walk freely they were told by their younger brothers fine they said and so they pulled out the ends of their loincloths and these immediately became tails they appeared just like spider monkeys thus they went up into the tops of the trees there in the small mountains and the great mountains they went out into the forests howling and chattering loudly in the branches of the trees thus was the defeat of one batz and one chouen at the hands of hunahpu and xbalanque it was merely by their enchantments that it was done now when they arrived back at their home they spoke with their grandmother and mother our grandmother something has happened to our older brothers their faces have changed they go about like animals now they said if you have done something to your older brothers you will cause me misery and anguish let this not be what you have done to your older brothers my grandsons said the grandmother to hunahpu and xbalanque they replied then to their grandmother do not grieve our grandmother you shall see again the faces of our older brothers they will come back but this is a test for you our grandmother please do not laugh for we will test their fate they said thus they began to play the flute they played hunahpu spider monkey on the flute the fall of one batz and one chouen then they began to sing to play the flute and to play the drum and when they had taken up their flute and their drum the grandmother sat down with them as well thus they played the flute calling them with the music in song they called out their names with the music whose name is hunahpu spider monkey then arrived one batz and one chouen dancing as they came but when the grandmother looked at them she saw their ugly faces and laughed for she could not contain her laughter figure 40 in song they called out their names with the music whose name is hunahpu spider monkey then arrived one batz and one chouen dancing as they came dancing monkey from a classic maya vase rollout photograph justin kerr 1980 file no 1208 therefore they immediately went away their faces could not be seen anymore for they had gone back into the forest what now will you do our grandmother we shall try it four times in all only three times more we shall call them with flute music and song but you must truly contain your laughter when we try it again said hunahpu and xbalanque then they played the flute again and again they came dancing in the middle of the house patio animatedly they did it tempting their grandmother to laughter thus immediately the grandmother began to laugh again for the faces of the spider monkeys were truly funny they were paunchy and naked below their chests and when they came she laughed a great deal which made them depart again into the mountains surely what more can we do our grandmother this third time we shall try it again said hunahpu and xbalanque thus they played the flute again and again they came dancing but this time the grandmother was able to contain well her laughter they therefore scampered on the wall their mouths were very red and their faces were foolish their mouths were puckered and bushy their faces were silly and they snorted at them now when she saw this the grandmother again burst out laughing never again were their faces seen because of the laughter of their grandmother but this once more our grandmother we shall call upon them thus for the fourth time they played their flutes again but this time they did not come back instead they remained out in the forest thus they spoke to their grandmother we tried our grandmother and at first they came back we have tried to call them back again but do not grieve we are your grandsons and we are here just love our mother o grandmother our older brothers will be remembered thus be it so they were given names and also given titles one batz and one chouen shall be called upon said hunahpu and xbalanque figure 41 the ancient ones also called upon them they who were the writers and the carvers monkey scribe redrawn from a classic maya vase and since that time they have been called upon by the flautists and the singers the ancient ones also called upon them they who were the writers and the carvers a long time ago they became animals they became spider monkeys because of their pride for they had abused their younger brothers according to the dictates of their hearts thus they were ruined one batz and one chouen were lost becoming animals thus their community and their home is now among the flautists and the singers for great were their accomplishments when they dwelt with their grandmother and their mother hunahpu and xbalanque in the maizefield then they began again to accomplish their deeds to manifest themselves before the face of their grandmother and before the face of their mother first they worked the maizefield we are going to farm the maizefield our grandmother and our mother they said we are the substitutes for our older brothers said hunahpu and xbalanque thus they took up their axes and their hoes carrying them on their shoulders each of them also shouldered his blowgun and departed their home having first left instructions with their grandmother to bring their food at midday come to give us our food grandmother they said very well then my grandsons said their grandmother then they arrived there to farm the maizefield they merely stuck the hoe into the ground and it truly began to plow the earth all by itself the hoe did the plowing for them figure 42 then they arrived there to farm the maizefield they merely stuck the hoe into the ground and it truly began to plow the earth andr s xiloj a prominent aj q'ij from momostenango working his maizefield with a hoe photo by garrett cook as for the axe they just stuck it into the fork of a tree and by its own strength it would fell it thus the one axe chopped and felled all the trees and bushes feverishly working to cut down the trees all by itself now this the hoe would break up countless stalks and briars just the one hoe would clear countless mountains both small and great as it went then they gave instructions to an animal turtle dove by name hunahpu and xbalanque placed it atop a great stump and spoke to it when you see our grandmother coming to bring our food immediately cry out that she has arrived then we will take up the hoe and the axe very well said the turtle dove thus they merely hunted with their blowguns they didn t truly farm the maize and when the turtle dove cried out they came quickly the one taking up the hoe while the other one took up the axe they would then put field debris on their heads and rub dirt on their hands the one would dirty his face as if he had truly farmed the maizefield while the other one would scatter wood chips on his head as if he had truly been cutting down trees in this way they were seen by the grandmother and thus they were given to eat they did not truly farm the maize and so it was unmerited that she went to give them their food and when they returned home they would say we are truly tired our grandmother and they would rub and stretch their legs and arms in front of their grandmother to deceive her but on the second day they arrived at the maizefield to find that all the trees and bushes had been raised up again all the stalks and briars had again fastened themselves together who is playing tricks on us they asked therefore now it was all the animals both great and small that had done it the puma and the jaguar the deer and the rabbit the fox and the coyote the peccary and the coati the small birds and the great birds these had done it in a single night they did it thus they began again to farm the maize again the earth was broken up the trees were cut down there they gathered their thoughts over by the cut trees and the broken ground we will just watch over our maizefield tonight and thus we will discover whatever it was that has done this they said when they gathered together their thoughts so when they returned to the house they said someone perhaps has been playing tricks on us our grandmother when we arrived a while ago at our maizefield we found that it had become a great field of grass and a great forest once again they said to their grandmother and their mother therefore we shall go back and watch over it by night for it is not good what has been done to us they said thus they concealed themselves they went out again to cut down the trees and then they hid themselves there taking cover at length all the animals gathered together coming together as one all the small and great animals arrived in the very heart of the night chattering as they came and this was their speech figure 43 at length all the animals gathered together coming together as one all the small and great animals arrived in the very heart of the night chattering as they came procession of animals from a classic maya vase rollout photograph justin kerr 1987 file no 3332 arise trees arise bushes they said when they came thus they congregated beneath the trees and the bushes emerging where they could be seen before their faces the first of these were the puma and the jaguar the boys wanted to grab them but they would not give themselves up then emerged the deer and the rabbit they grabbed them by their tails but these just broke off leaving the tail of the deer behind in their hands along with the tail of the rabbit thus they still have shortened tails neither would these give themselves up the fox or the coyote the peccary or the coati all the animals just passed on by in front of hunahpu and xbalanque thus their hearts were troubled because they weren t able to catch any of them but one more came along behind all the rest he scurried when he came and they netted him they snared the rat in a net they caught him and squeezed him behind the head according to their desire they strangled him and burned his tail over a fire because they did this to the tail of the rat their tails still do not have hair on them and their eyes are the way they are because the boys hunahpu and xbalanque strangled him i must not die by your hands your task is not to be maize farmers but there is something that is yours said the rat where is that which is ours speak then the boys said to the rat will you first let me go asked the rat my word is here in my belly i will tell it to you if you first give me a little food we will give you your food later but tell us first he was told very well then it is what belonged to your fathers one hunahpu and seven hunahpu by name who died in xibalba they left behind their gaming things hanging above the house their yokes their arm protectors and their rubber ball as well your grandmother did not show these to you for it was because of them that your fathers died is it not true do you truly know this the boys asked the rat thus they rejoiced in their hearts when they heard from the rat the news about the rubber ball this therefore was given to the rat as his food grains of maize squash seeds chili peppers beans pataxte and cacao these then are yours if anything has been swept out with the trash and has become exposed then it is yours you shall gnaw on it said hunahpu and xbalanque to the rat very well then boys but what will i say if your grandmother sees you he asked don t be disheartened they said to the rat we are here we know what to say to our grandmother we will lift you up onto the corner of the house to fetch them straightaway you will go up to where the things are hanging we will be able to see it in the rafters of the house reflected in our sauce thus hunahpu and xbalanque gathered their thoughts and instructed him all night and when it was truly midday they arrived hunahpu and xbalanque discover the gaming things the rat they carried could not be seen clearly when they arrived while one went into the house the other went around to the corner of the house and immediately lifted up the rat then they asked their mother for their food just prepare for us a bite to eat they said we desire chili sauce our grandmother thus their bite was prepared and a plate of sauce was placed before them but this was just a trick they were playing on their grandmother and their mother they drained the water jug dry we are truly thirsty bring us something to drink they said to their grandmother all right she replied thus she left leaving them behind to eat but it was not true that they were hungry it was merely a deception so that they could see the rat reflected in their chili sauce there the rat was behind the rubber ball where it hung above the house this they saw reflected in their chili sauce then they sent forth a mosquito the mosquito is an insect similar to a small biting fly it went to the river and pierced the front of the grandmother s jug figure 44 thus the water that she had raised leaked out from the front of the jug try as she might the face of the jug would not be sealed grandmother goddess with a flowing jug redrawn from the dresden codex p 39b villacorta and villacorta 1930 thus the water that she had raised leaked out from the front of the jug try as she might the face of the jug would not be sealed what is our grandmother doing we are gasping for water we are parched with thirst they said to their mother thus they sent her away then the rat clawed at the ropes that held the rubber ball from the thatch roof above the house until it fell along with the yokes the arm protectors and the leathers they carried them away and hid them along the road leading to the ballcourt figure 45 then the rat clawed at the ropes that held the rubber ball from the thatch roof above the house until it fell rat holding a bound rubber ball from a classic maya stucco panel at tonina drawing by linda schele then they went back to where their grandmother was at the river and there they found their grandmother and mother busily trying to seal the face of the jug thus they arrived at the river each carrying his blowgun what have you been doing our hearts became weary so we came they said look at the front of my jug it cannot be sealed off replied their grandmother immediately then they sealed it and together they returned once more leading the way before their grandmother thus was the discovery of this rubber ball the summons of hunahpu and xbalanque to xibalba and so they went rejoicing as ballplayers to the ballcourt for a long time they played ball there alone sweeping clear the ballcourt of their father figure 46 and so they went rejoicing as ballplayers to the ballcourt for a long time they played ball there alone sweeping clear the ballcourt of their father ballcourt at iximche guatemala then the lords of xibalba heard it someone has begun to play again over our heads have they no shame stomping about up there did not one hunahpu and seven hunahpu die when they desired to puff themselves up before us go then to summon them here once again said one death and seven death along with all the lords summon them here they said to their messengers tell them they must come say the lords here we shall play ball with them in seven days we will play say the lords tell them this when you arrive there the messengers were told thus they came along the great cleared pathway the road that led to the home of the boys the messengers pursued them into the home of the grandmother but the boys were still playing ball when the messengers of xibalba arrived the lords say they must surely come said the messengers of xibalba then the messengers of xibalba set the date in seven days they will be expected such was the word left with xmucane very well then replied the grandmother they shall go as summoned you messengers thus the messengers returned again leaving the grandmother heartbroken how shall i tell my grandsons of their summons were these not truly from xibalba they are just like the messengers who arrived in the past when their fathers went away to die said the grandmother thus she wept bitterly in the house alone then a louse fell down on her it itched so she picked it up and put it in her hand the louse scuttled as it went along my grandchild she asked the louse would you like me to send you to summon my grandsons at the ballcourt thus he left as a summoner with this message messengers have arrived with your grandmother saying that you are to come the messengers of xibalba declare in seven days you are to come says your grandmother such was the message given to the louse and so he went scuttling along the way now sitting in the road was a youthful toad by the name of tamazul where are you going asked the toad of the louse i am going to give the boys a message that is in my belly said the louse to tamazul very well then but i see that you are not going very fast the toad said to the louse wouldn t you like me to swallow you then you would see how fast i could go we would get there quickly very well said the louse to the toad thus he was licked up by the toad who went hopping along his way but he did not go fast presently he was met by a great snake whose name was white life where are you going boy tamazul asked white life i am a messenger with a message in my belly said the toad to the snake but i see that you aren t going very fast perhaps i would arrive there more quickly said the snake to the toad go right ahead he was told thus the toad was swallowed up by white life the snake then received his food and they still swallow toads today now this snake went quickly along his way then again the snake was met by the falcon a great bird and the snake was swallowed by the falcon then he arrived atop the ballcourt thus the hawk received his food so that he still eats snakes in the mountains when the falcon arrived he alighted atop the edge of the ballcourt while hunahpu and xbalanque were rejoicing and playing ball figure 47 when the falcon arrived he alighted atop the edge of the ballcourt while hunahpu and xbalanque were rejoicing and playing ball the laughing falcon sutton 1951 198 then the falcon cried out wak ko wak ko was the cry of the falcon what is that which is crying out to our blowguns they said hunahpu and xbalanque receive the summons to xibalba so then they shot the falcon the pellet from the blowgun buried itself straight into his eye knocking him down thus he fell and they went out to grab him and question him why have you come they asked the falcon i have a message in my belly but surely you must first cure my eye and then i will tell it said the falcon very well then they replied so they took off a little of the surface of their rubber ball and put it in the face of the falcon this they called sliced rubber immediately he was cured by them making good again the sight of the falcon tell it then they said to the falcon thus he vomited the great snake speak they said again to the snake all right he replied and so he vomited the toad what is your errand speak the toad was told my message is here in my belly said again the toad then he tried to throw up but he did not vomit his mouth just drooled he tried but nothing did he vomit thus the boys wished to beat him you are a deceiver he was told then they squashed his rear end with their feet crushing the bones of his backside with their feet again he tried but he just salivated at the mouth so they pried open the mouth of the toad it was pried open wide by the boys they searched in his mouth and found that the louse was merely stuck in front of the toad s teeth he was just in his mouth he hadn t really been swallowed it was merely as if he had been swallowed thus the toad was defeated as a result it is not obvious what food was given to him he could not go fast thus he merely became spoil for the snake speak the louse was told thus he spoke his word the grandmother says to you boys go and summon them messengers have arrived from xibalba the messengers of one death and seven death in seven days they will come here to play ball with us they must bring their gaming things the rubber ball yokes arm protectors and leathers they will liven up this place say the lords this is their word that has come says your grandmother thus you must come the grandmother truly says your grandmother weeps she calls out that you must come is it not true they asked in their hearts when they heard this and immediately they returned to advise their grandmother the descent of hunahpu and xbalanque into xibalba surely we must go our grandmother but first we will advise you this is the sign of our word that we will leave behind each of us shall first plant an ear of unripe maize in the center of the house if they dry up this is a sign of our death they have died you will say when they dry up if then they sprout again they are alive you will say our grandmother and our mother this is the sign of our word that is left with you they said thus hunahpu planted one and xbalanque planted another in the house they did not plant them in the mountains or in fertile ground it was merely in dry ground in the middle of the interior of their home that they planted them figure 48 each of us shall first plant an ear of unripe maize in the center of the house an effigy maize stalk set up in a ritual house as a tree of life in santiago atitl n painting by miguel ch vez petzey then they left each with his blowgun and descended to xibalba they quickly went down the steps passing through various river canyons they passed through the midst of many birds flocks was the name of the birds and again they passed over pus river and blood river in their hearts the xibalbans had intended these as traps but they were not troubled they just passed over them floating on their blowguns when they came to the four crossroads they already knew the roads of xibalba the black road the white road the red road and the blue green road then they sent an insect named mosquito they sent him on ahead to obtain for them what he could hear you shall bite each one of them in turn bite the first one seated there and then keep on biting them until you have finished biting all of them it will be truly yours then to suck the blood of people on the road the mosquito was told very well then said the mosquito so then he went along the black road until he alighted behind the effigies of carved wood the first ones were all dressed up he bit the first one but there was no response then he bit the second one seated there but he did not speak either figure 49 thus they came to where the xibalbans were death god from the dresden codex p 13b villacorta and villacorta 1930 next he bit the third one seated there who was one death ouch said each one when he was bitten what was their reply ow said one death what one death what is it i am being bitten it s just ow what was that now i am being bitten said the fourth one seated there what seven death what is it i am being bitten next the one seated fifth said ow ow flying scab asked seven death what is it i am being bitten he said then the sixth one seated there was bitten ow what gathered blood what is it asked flying scab i am being bitten he said next the seventh one seated there was bitten ow he said what pus demon what is it asked gathered blood i am being bitten he said then the eighth one seated there was bitten ow he said what jaundice demon what is it asked pus demon i am being bitten he said then the ninth one seated there was bitten ow he said what bone staff what is it asked jaundice demon i am being bitten he said then the tenth one seated there was bitten ow what skull staff what is it asked bone staff i am being bitten he said then the eleventh one seated there was bitten ow he said next what wing what is it asked skull staff i am being bitten he said next the twelfth one seated there was bitten ow he said what packstrap what is it asked wing i am being bitten next was bitten the thirteenth one seated there ow what bloody teeth what is it asked packstrap i am being bitten he said then the fourteenth seated one was bitten ow what bloody claws what is it asked bloody teeth i am being bitten he said thus their names were named each of them revealed the name of the other each of the individuals in order of their rank had his name revealed by the one who sat next to him not one of their names was missed until all of the names were named when they were bitten by a hair that hunahpu had plucked from the front of his knee it wasn t really a mosquito that had bitten them and so hunahpu and xbalanque heard the names of all of them thus they came to where the xibalbans were hail these lords who are seated there said a tempter these are not lords these are merely effigies carved of wood they said then they hailed each one of them morning one death morning seven death morning flying scab morning gathered blood morning pus demon morning jaundice demon morning bone staff morning skull staff morning wing morning packstrap morning bloody teeth morning bloody claws they said when they arrived there all of them had their faces revealed for all of their names were named not one of their names was missed when they were called upon they gave the names of each one without leaving any of them out sit down here they were told for it was desired that they sit on top of the bench but they didn t want to this isn t a bench for us it is merely a heated stone said hunahpu and xbalanque thus they were not defeated very well then just go into that house they were told so then they entered into the house of darkness but they were not defeated there either in their hearts the xibalbans ordained that they would be defeated there in this the first of the trials of xibalba thus they entered first into the house of darkness there the messenger of one death gave to them a torch already burning and a cigar for each of them and the messenger said when he arrived thus says the lord here is their torch it must be given back at dawn along with the cigars they must return them very well they replied but they didn t light the torch they just placed the red tail feather of a macaw on it as a substitute for flame thus the night watchmen saw it as if it were burning as for the cigars they just put fireflies on their tips all night they would glow brilliantly because of them figure 50 as for the cigars they just put fireflies on their tips all night they would glow brilliantly because of them firefly redrawn from a classic maya vase coe 1973 99 we have defeated them said the night watchmen but the torch was not used up for it was only an illusion neither did the cigars have anything burning on them it was merely an illusion as well thus they returned them whole to the lords what becomes of them where did they come from who begat them who gave them birth truly our hearts are troubled for it is not good what they are doing to us their appearance as well as their nature are unique they said one to another then they summoned all of the lords let us play ball boys they were told but first they were questioned by one death and seven death where did you really come from would you tell us boys they were asked by the xibalbans we must have come from somewhere but we don t know only this they said they told them nothing very well then we will just go and play ball boys the xibalbans said to them fine they replied here is our rubber ball that we will use said the xibalbans no we will use ours said the boys not so we will use this one that is ours said again the xibalbans very well said the boys it appears to be a skull but it is merely drawn on the ball said the xibalbans figure 51 it appears to be a skull but it is merely a drawing skull within a rubber ball from a wall panel in the great ballcourt at chichen itza drawing by linda schele it is not it is a skull we tell you said the boys not so replied the xibalbans very well then said hunahpu thus the xibalbans threw down their rubber ball which landed before the yoke of hunahpu and when the xibalbans saw this the white dagger came out of their rubber ball it clashed about over the ground of the entire ballcourt threatening the boys what is that asked hunahpu and xbalanque you just want death for us did we not answer your summons when your messenger came have pity on us we will just go then said the boys to them it was their desire that the boys would straightaway die there because of the blade they were to have been defeated but it was not so it was the xibalbans who were now defeated by the boys don t go boys we will just play with your ball the boys were told very well then they replied thus they took out their rubber ball and it was thrown down then their prizes were chosen what will we win the xibalbans asked surely it is your choice the boys said our prize shall be merely four bowls of flowers said the xibalbans very well what kinds of flowers the boys asked the xibalbans one bowl of red petals one bowl of white petals one bowl of yellow petals and one bowl of the large ones said the xibalbans very well replied the boys so then the ball was dropped into play they were equal in strength but the boys made many plays with the ball for they played with all their hearts at last the boys gave themselves up to be defeated and the xibalbans thus rejoiced at their defeat figure 52 so then the ball was dropped into play they were equal in strength but the boys made many plays with the ball for they played with all their hearts ballplayer lunging for the ball from a classic maya panel from site q drawing by linda schele we have done well we have already defeated them at the first attempt said the xibalbans where shall they go to get the flowers they asked in their hearts you will give to us the flowers as our prize early in the morning the boys hunahpu and xbalanque were told by the xibalbans very well we will play ball again early in the morning they said then they made their plans together thus the boys entered into blade house the second trial of xibalba here it was desired that they would be sliced apart by the blades they were to have died quickly in their hearts but they did not die they spoke to the blades instructing them in this way yours shall be the flesh of animals they said to the blades thus they stopped moving as one they all lowered the points of their blades and while they were passing the night in blade house they called out to all the ants cutting ants conquering ants come go and get flower blossoms as prizes for the lords very well they said then the ants went to get flowers from the garden of one death and seven death now the xibalbans had previously instructed the guardians of their flowers look after our flowers with all vigilance do not allow them to be stolen for by these we have defeated the boys what if they were able to obtain these as our prize thus do not sleep all night very well they said then but the guardians of the garden did not notice anything they would just cry out aimlessly in the branches of the trees they just toddled along through the garden repeating their song shpurpuwek shpurpuwek said the one when he called puhuyu puhuyu said the other the whippoorwill by name when he called these two were the guardians of the garden of one death and seven death they didn t notice the ants stealing that which they were guarding they swarmed and thronged carrying away the flowers they went to cut down flowers from the tops of trees gathering them together with those from below the trees all this they did while the guardians were crying out not noticing that their tails and wings were being gnawed on as well the flowers were thus loosened until they fell down to be gathered up the four bowls were thus quickly filled with their flowers by dawn they had all been collected then the messengers arrived to summon them come says the lord may they straightaway bring hither our prize the boys were told very well they answered for they had collected the flowers into the four bowls thus they went arriving before the lords now the lords received the flowers with woeful faces thus the xibalbans were defeated the boys had just sent ants and in one night they had collected the flowers in the bowls thus the xibalbans all turned pale their faces were pallid because of the flowers and so they summoned the flower guardians for what reason have you allowed our flowers to be stolen these flowers that you see are ours the guardians were told we noticed nothing o lords but our tails have surely suffered for it they replied then their mouths were split open as punishment for allowing that which they were guarding to be stolen thus one death and seven death were defeated by hunahpu and xbalanque and this is the reason why the mouths of whippoorwills gape wide open to this day then the ball was dropped into play again but the game was even and when they had finished playing ball they planned together once more at dawn again said the xibalbans very well said the boys when they had finished hunahpu and xbalanque in the house of cold and so they now entered the house of cold the cold here was immeasurable the interior of the house of cold was thick with hail but straightaway the boys caused the cold to dissipate they did it in they ruined and destroyed the cold thus they did not die but rather were alive when it dawned again the xibalbans had wanted them to die there but this was not to be instead they were just fine when the dawn came so then their guardians came again to summon them what is this haven t they died asked the lords of xibalba and again they marveled at the deeds of the boys hunahpu and xbalanque hunahpu and xbalanque in the house of jaguars next they entered into jaguar house which was crowded inside with jaguars figure 53 next they entered into jaguar house which was crowded inside with jaguars underworld jaguar surrounded by waterlilies redrawn from a classic maya vase do not eat us we will give you what is yours the jaguars were told then they scattered bones before the beasts who voraciously crunched them the hearts of the night watchmen found this sweet saying they are finished they have given themselves up they have eaten their hearts and now these are their skeletons that are being gnawed upon but they didn t die they were just fine when they came out again from jaguar house what kind of people are these where have they come from asked all the xibalbans hunahpu and xbalanque in the house of fire next they went into the fire for there was a house of fire there was nothing but fire inside but they were not burned they were to have been roasted and set aflame instead they were just fine when dawn came it had been desired that they would straightaway die when they passed through there but it was not so thus all the xibalbans lost heart as a result hunahpu and xbalanque in the house of bats next they were put inside bat house which had only bats inside it was a house of death bats these were great beasts with snouts like blades that they used as murderous weapons figure 54 next they were put inside bat house which had only bats inside it was a house of death bats underworld bat from a classic maya vase rollout photograph justin kerr 1991 file no 5224 when they arrived there they were to be finished off they had to crawl inside their blowguns to sleep so that they would not be eaten there in this house nevertheless it was because of a single death bat that they gave themselves up in defeat it came swooping down but this was merely a way to manifest themselves when it occured thus they pleaded for wisdom all that night as the bats made a din with their flapping wings keeleetz keeleetz they said all night long at length things quieted a little and the bats became motionless thus one of the boys crawled to the end of his blowgun xbalanque said hunahpu do you see the dawn yet i will go and see for certain if has happened he replied hunahpu truly wanted to look out of the mouth of his blowgun to see the dawn but when he did so his head was cut off by the death bat leaving the greater part of his body behind what hasn t it dawned yet asked xbalanque but hunahpu did not move what is going on hunahpu wouldn t have left what then has he done but nothing moved only the rustling of wings was heard thus xbalanque was ashamed alas we have given in already he said at the word of one death and seven death the head was placed atop the ballcourt thus all the xibalbans rejoiced because of the head of hunahpu then xbalanque summoned all of the animals the coati and the peccary and all the animals both small and great while it was still dark early in the morning he then entreated them for their food i send each of you to bring the food that belongs to you said xbalanque to them very well they said then they all went to obtain what was theirs when they returned they were many one brought back rotten things another brought leaves another brought stones and yet another brought dirt thus the animals both small and great each brought their various foods now after many had come the coati arrived last of all bringing a chilacayote squash she came rolling it along with her nose this was to be transformed into the head of hunahpu immediately its eyes were carved upon it numerous sages came down from the sky for heart of sky he who is huracan appeared here he arrived here in bat house but the face wasn t completed successfully in time only its beautiful covering had appeared it only had the ability to speak by the time the horizon of the sky began to redden for it was about to dawn blacken it again with soot old man the possum was told figure 55 blacken it again with soot old man the possum was told opossum deity bearing torches from the dresden codex p 39a villacorta and villacorta 1930 fine replied the grandfather and he blackened the sky with soot until it was dark again four times the grandfather blackened it with soot thus today people say the possum blackens it with soot finally the sky succeeded in turning red and then blue when it began its existence is it not good hunahpu was asked yes it is good he replied for his head was well supported it became just like a true head then they planned a deception they took counsel together don t play ball just look threatening i will surely be the one to accomplish it said xbalanque to him then he instructed a rabbit be there at the head of the ballcourt in the tomato patch the rabbit was told by xbalanque and when the rubber ball comes your way hop away until i accomplish my task the rabbit was told thus he was given his instructions there in the night and when it dawned the both of them were well the head of hunahpu is restored so the ball was again dropped into play the head of hunahpu was first placed atop the ballcourt we have already triumphed you are finished you gave in so give it up they were told but hunahpu just called out strike the head as if it were a rubber ball they were told no harm will come to us now for we are holding our own thus the lords of xibalba threw down the ball where it was met by xbalanque the ball landed before his yoke and bounced away it sailed clear over the ballcourt it just bounced once then twice landing in the tomatoes then the rabbit came out hopping along all the xibalbans thus went after him the xibalbans all went after the rabbit shouting and rushing about figure 56 the ball landed before his yoke and bounced away it sailed clear over the ballcourt it just bounced once then twice landing in the tomatoes then the rabbit came out hopping along ballplayer with a rabbit from a classic maya vessel drawing by linda schele thus the twins were able to retrieve the head of hunahpu replacing it where the chilacayote squash had been they then placed the chilacayote squash on the ballcourt while the true head of hunahpu was his once more therefore they both rejoiced again while the xibalbans were out searching for their rubber ball the twins retrieved it from the tomato patch and when they had done so they called out come on we found our rubber ball they said thus they were carrying the round ball when the xibalbans returned what was it that we saw they asked and so they began again to play ball both teams making equal plays until at last xbalanque struck the chilacayote squash strewing it all over the ballcourt thus its seeds were scattered before them what is this that has been brought here where is he that brought it asked the xibalbans thus the lords of xibalba were defeated by hunahpu and xbalanque they had passed through great affliction but despite everything that had been done to them they did not die the deaths of hunahpu and xbalanque this then is the memorial to the deaths of hunahpu and xbalanque we shall now tell it in memory of their death what they had planned to do they had done despite all their afflictions and misfortunes thus they did not die in the trials of xibalba neither were they defeated by all the ravenous beasts that lived there and then they summoned two seers visionary persons they were the names of these sages were descended and ascended the lords of xibalba may inquire of you concerning our death they are even now putting together their thoughts on the matter because we have not yet died we have not been defeated we confounded their trials nor have the animals seized us this therefore is the sign that is in our hearts heated stones will be the means by which our murder will be accomplished thus when all xibalba has gathered together to determine how to ensure our death this shall be the idea that you will propose if you are asked about our death when we are burned this is what you shall tell them you descended and you ascended if they should speak to you about it wouldn t it perhaps be good if we scatter their bones in the canyon then you are to say this would not be good for they would merely arise again to new life then they will say to you perhaps it would be good to merely hang them in the top of a tree you will then reply certainly that would not be good for you would see their faces before you then the third time they will say would it be a good thing if we merely scatter their bones in the course of the river if then you are asked this you will reply it is good that they should die and it would be good if their bones were ground upon the face of a stone like finely ground maize flour each one of them should be ground separately then these should be scattered there in the course of the river they should be sprinkled on the river that winds among the small and great mountains this then is what you will say thus will be made manifest what we have said to you in counsel said hunahpu and xbalanque for when they had thus counseled them they already knew of their death the xibalbans were even then putting together the great heated stones in the form of a pit oven placing large hot coals within it then came the messengers of one death and seven death to accompany them the lords say to us may they come bring them so that they may see what we have cooked up for them this is the word of the lords unto you boys they were told very well they replied thus they went quickly to the mouth of the pit oven there the xibalbans wanted to force them into playing with them figure 57 there the xibalbans wanted to force them into playing with them ceramic figurine of an underworld demon from tapijulapa regional museum of tabasco villahermosa let us jump over this our sweet drink four times each of us will go across it boys they were told by one death you cannot trick us with this do we not already know the means of our death o lords you shall surely see it they said then they turned to face one another spread out their arms and together they went into the pit oven thus both of them died there then all the xibalbans rejoiced at this they contentedly shouted and whistled we have defeated them none too soon have they given themselves up they said then they summoned descended and ascended with whom word had been left by the boys and the xibalbans divined of them what was to be done with their bones thus according to their word the bones were ground up and strewn along the course of the river but they did not go far away they just straightaway sank there beneath the water and when they appeared again it was as chosen boys for thus they had become the resurrection of hunahpu and xbalanque on the fifth day they appeared again people saw them in the river for the two of them appeared like people fish now when their faces were seen by the xibalbans they made a search for them in the rivers figure 58 people saw them in the river for the two of them appeared like mere people fish fish redrawn from a classic maya vase and on the very next day they appeared again as two poor orphans they wore rags in front and rags on their backs rags were thus all they had to cover themselves but they did not act according to their appearance when they were seen by the xibalbans for they did the dance of the whippoorwill and the dance of the weasel they danced the armadillo and the centipede they danced the injury for many marvels they did then they set fire to a house as if it were truly burning then immediately recreated it again as the xibalbans watched with admiration then again they sacrificed themselves one of them would die surely throwing himself down in death then having been killed he would immediately be revived and the xibalbans simply watched them while they did it now all of this was merely the groundwork for the defeat of the xibalbans at their hands the summons of hunahpu and xbalanque before the lords at length the news of their dances came to the ears of the lords one death and seven death and when they had heard of it they said who are these two poor orphans is it truly delightful is it true that their dancing and all that they do is beautiful for the lords were delighted with the account when they heard it thus they entreated their messengers to summon them to come say this to them may they come so that we may watch them for we marvel at them say the lords thus the messengers went to the dancers and repeated the words of the lords to them we don t want to for in truth we are timid we would be ashamed to enter into such a lordly house our faces are truly ugly and our eyes are just wide in poverty don t they see that we are merely dancers what then would we say to our fellow orphans we have responsibilities they also desire our dances for they revive their faces with us it is not right that we should do the same with the lords therefore we do not want to do this o messengers said hunahpu and xbalanque but they were pestered threatened with misfortune and pain and so they went with apprehension for they didn t want to be going any too soon many times they had to be prodded because they just walked along slowly making little progress while the messengers who brought them led the way to the lords hunahpu and xbalanque dance before the lords of xibalba at length they arrived before the lords they pretended to be humble prostrating themselves when they came they humbled themselves stooping over and bowing they hid themselves with rags giving the appearance that they were truly just poor orphans when they arrived then they were asked where their home mountain was and who their people were they were also asked about their mother and their father where do you come from they were asked we do not know o lord neither do we know the faces of our mother or our father we were still small when they died they just said they didn t tell them anything very well then on with the spectacle what do you want us to give you as payment they were asked we don t want anything truly we are frightened they said again to the lord do not be afraid or timid dance first you will do that dance in which you sacrifice yourselves then burn down my home do everything that you know we would watch this for it was the desire of our hearts that you be summoned because you are poor orphans we will pay whatever you ask as your price they were told thus they began their songs and their dances and all the xibalbans came until the place was overflowing with spectators they danced everything they danced the weasel they danced the whippoorwill they danced the armadillo figure 59 they danced the armadillo armadillo dancer redrawn from a classic maya vase then the lord spoke to them sacrifice my dog then revive him again they were told all right they replied so they sacrificed his dog and then revived him once more the dog was truly happy when they revived him he vigorously wagged his tail when they brought him back to life then the lord spoke again to them now you must surely burn my home they were told so then they burned the home of the lord the house was overflowing with all the lords yet none were burned immediately it was restored again thus the home of one death was not lost after all all the lords marveled therefore and greatly rejoiced at their dances the lord thus spoke again to them now kill a person sacrifice him but not so that he really dies they were told very well they said so they grabbed a person and sacrificed him they extracted the heart of one of them and placed it before the lords now one death and seven death marveled at this for immediately that person was revived again by them when he had been revived his heart greatly rejoiced and again the lords marveled at it now sacrifice yourselves we would see this truly it is the desire of our hearts that you dance said again the lords very well then o lord they replied so then they sacrificed themselves hunahpu was sacrificed by xbalanque each of his legs and arms was severed his head was cut off and placed far away his heart was dug out and placed on a leaf now all these lords of xibalba were drunk at the sight as xbalanque went on dancing arise he said and immediately he was brought back to life again now the lords rejoiced greatly one death and seven death rejoiced as if they were the ones doing it they were so involved that it was as if they themselves were dancing figure 60 one death and seven death rejoiced as if they were the ones doing it they were so involved that it was as if they themselves were dancing death god dancing at an underworld sacrifice from a classic maya vase coe 1973 99 the defeat of the lords of xibalba for it was the desire of the lords to abandon their hearts to the dances of hunahpu and xbalanque then came the words of one death and seven death do it to us sacrifice us they said sacrifice us in the same way said one death and seven death to hunahpu and xbalanque very well then surely you will be revived are you not death for we are here to gladden you o lords along with your vassals and your servants they said therefore to the lords the first to be sacrificed was the very head of all the lords one death by name the lord of xibalba he was dead then this one death next they grabbed seven death but they didn t revive them thus the xibalbans took to their heels when they saw that the lords had died their hearts were now taken from their chests both of them had been torn open as punishment for what they had done straightaway the one lord was executed and not revived the other lord had then begged humbly weeping before the dancers he would not accept it for he had become disoriented figure 61 next they grabbed seven death but they didn t revive them young deity sacrificing an underworld lord from a classic maya vase coe 1973 47 take pity on me he said in his regret then all of their vassals and servants fled into the great canyon they packed themselves into the great ravine until they were piled up one on top of the other then innumerable ants swarmed into the canyon as if they had been driven there and when the ants came the xibalbans all bowed themselves down giving themselves up they approached begging humbly and weeping for the lords of xibalba were defeated it was just a miracle for the boys had transformed themselves before them and then they declared their names they revealed their names before all xibalba the miraculous maize of hunahpu and xbalanque hear our names we shall now declare them we shall also declare the names of our fathers to you we are they whose names are hunahpu and xbalanque our fathers are they who you killed one hunahpu and seven hunahpu by name we are the avengers of the misfortune and affliction of our fathers for this reason we have endured all the tribulations that you have caused us thus we shall now destroy you all we will kill you for none among you shall now be saved they were told then all xibalba begged humbly weeping take pity on us you hunahpu and xbalanque truly we have wronged your fathers that you have named they who are buried at crushing ballcourt they said very well here then is our word that we declare to you hearken all you of xibalba for never again will you or your posterity be great your offerings also will never again be great they will henceforth be reduced to croton sap no longer will clean blood be yours unto you will be given only worn out griddles and pots only flimsy and brittle things you shall surely eat only the creatures of the grass and the creatures of the wastelands no longer will you be given the children of the light those begotten in the light only things of no importance will fall before you only the sinner and the malevolent the wretch and the molester who clearly have sinned will be given to you no longer will you be able to seize suddenly just any person you will be called upon only over the sap of the croton they were told all they of xibalba thus began their devastation the ruin of their being called upon in worship their glory was not great in the past for they wanted only conflict with the people of ancient times surely they were not true gods their names merely inspired fear for their faces were evil they were strife makers traitors and tempters to sin and violence they were also masters of deception of the black view and the white view they were called masters of harm and vexation fundamentally their faces were hidden thus their greatness and glory were destroyed never again would their dominion become great this was the accomplishment of hunahpu and xbalanque figure 62 their names merely inspired fear for their faces were evil a masked xibalban dancer momostenango photograph by garrett cook now at the same time the grandmother was weeping crying out before the ears of unripe maize that had been left planted they had sprouted but then they dried up when they were burned in the pit oven then the ears of maize had sprouted once again and the grandmother had burned copal incense before them as a memorial the heart of their grandmother rejoiced when the maize sprouted a second time thus they were deified by their grandmother she named it center house center ancestral plot revitalized maize and leveled earth she named it center house and center harvest for it was in the very center of the interior of their home where they had planted the ears of maize she named it leveled earth and revitalized maize for it was upon level ground that the ears of maize had been planted she named it revitalized maize because the maize had sprouted again these names were given by xmucane to what hunahpu and xbalanque had left planted this was a memorial to them by their grandmother now their fathers one hunahpu and seven hunahpu had died long ago they now went therefore to see the face of their father there at xibalba their father spoke to them when xibalba was defeated the apotheosis of the sun moon and stars here now is the adornment of their father by them along with the adornment of seven hunahpu for they went to adorn them at crushing ballcourt figure 63 here now is the adornment of their father by them the resurrection of the maize god assisted by his twin sons from a classic maya plate drawing by linda schele they merely wanted his face to be restored thus they asked him to name everything his mouth his nose and his eyes he was able to recover the first name but then little more was said he did not say the corresponding names for that which is above the mouth still this had been said and thus they honored him thus the heart of their father was left behind at crushing ballcourt his sons then said to him here you will be called upon it shall be so thus his heart was comforted the child who is born in the light and the son who is begotten in the light shall go out to you first they shall worship you first your name shall not be forgotten thus be it so they said to their father when they comforted his heart we are merely the avengers of your death and your loss for the affliction and misfortune that were done to you thus was their counsel when they had defeated all xibalba then they arose as the central lights they arose straight into the sky one of them arose as the sun and the other as the moon thus the womb of the sky was illuminated over the face of the earth for they came to dwell in the sky the four hundred boys who had died at the hands of zipacna also rose up to become their companions they became a constellation of the sky the creation of humanity this then is the beginning of the conception of humanity when that which would become the flesh of mankind was sought then spoke they who are called she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons the framer and the shaper sovereign and quetzal serpent the dawn approaches and our work is not successfully completed a provider and a sustainer have yet to appear a child of light a son of light humanity has yet to appear to populate the face of the earth they said thus they gathered together and joined their thoughts in the darkness in the night they searched and they sifted here they thought and they pondered their thoughts came forth bright and clear they discovered and established that which would become the flesh of humanity this took place just a little before the appearance of the sun moon and stars above the heads of the framer and the shaper the discovery of maize it was from within the places called paxil and cayala that the yellow ears of ripe maize and the white ears of ripe maize came these were the names of the animals that obtained their food fox and coyote parakeet and raven four then were the animals that revealed to them the yellow ears of maize and the white ears of maize they came from paxil and pointed out the path to get there thus was found the food that would become the flesh of the newly framed and shaped people water was their blood it became the blood of humanity the ears of maize entered into their flesh by means of she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons thus they rejoiced over the discovery of that excellent mountain that was filled with delicious things crowded with yellow ears of maize and white ears of maize it was crowded as well with pataxte and chocolate with countless zapotes and anonas with jocotes and nances with matasanos and honey from within the places called paxil and cayala came the sweetest foods in the citadel all the small foods and great foods were there along with the small and great cultivated fields the path was thus revealed by the animals the yellow ears of maize and the white ears of maize were then ground fine with nine grindings by xmucane food entered their flesh along with water to give them strength thus was created the fatness of their arms the yellowness of humanity came to be when they were made by they who are called she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons by sovereign and quetzal serpent figure 64 the yellow ears of maize and the white ears of maize were then ground fine with nine grindings by xmucane quich woman grinding maize near momostenango thus their frame and shape were given expression by our first mother and our first father their flesh was merely yellow ears of maize and white ears of maize mere food were the legs and arms of humanity of our first fathers and so there were four who were made and mere food was their flesh the first four men these are the names of the first people who were framed and shaped the first person was balam quitze the second was balam acab the third was mahucutah and the fourth was iqui balam these then were the names of our first mothers and fathers the miraculous vision of the first men it is said that they were merely given frame and shape they had no mother they had no father they were merely lone men as we would say no woman gave them birth nor were they begotten by the framer or the shaper by she who has borne children or he who has begotten sons their frame and shape were merely brought about by the miraculous power and the spirit essence of the framer and the shaper of she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons of sovereign and quetzal serpent thus their countenances appeared like people people they came to be they were able to speak and converse they were able to look and listen they were able to walk and hold things with their hands they were excellent and chosen people their faces were manly in appearance they had their breath therefore they became they were able to see as well for straightaway their vision came to them figure 65 thus their frame and shape were given expression by our first mother and our first father their flesh was merely yellow ears of maize and white ears of maize quich men from the town of nahuala perfect was their sight and perfect was their knowledge of everything beneath the sky if they gazed about them looking intently they beheld that which was in the sky and that which was upon the earth instantly they were able to behold everything they did not have to walk to see all that existed beneath the sky they merely saw it from wherever they were thus their knowledge became full their vision passed beyond the trees and the rocks beyond the lakes and the seas beyond the mountains and the valleys truly they were very esteemed people these balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam the gratitude of the first men then the framer and the shaper asked them what is the nature of your existence do you know it do you not look and listen are not your speech and your walk good behold now therefore and see that which is beneath the sky are not the mountains clear do you not see the valleys try it then they were told thus their vision of everything beneath the sky was completed and they gave thanks to the framer and the shaper truly we thank you doubly triply that we were created that we were given our mouths and our faces we are able to speak and to listen we are able to ponder and to move about we know much for we have learned that which is far and near we have seen the great and the small all that exists in the sky and on the earth we thank you therefore that we were created that we were given frame and shape we became because of you our grandmother and you our grandfather they said when they gave thanks for their frame and shape their knowledge of everything that they saw was complete the four corners and the four sides that which is within the sky and that which is within the earth but this did not sound good to the framer and the shaper it is not good what they have said they that we have framed and shaped they said we have learned everything great and small the displeasure of the gods thus their knowledge was taken back by she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons what now can be done to them so that their vision reaches only nearby so that only a little of the face of the earth can be seen by them for it is not good what they say is not their existence merely framed merely shaped it is a mistake that they have become like gods but if they do not multiply or are increased when will the first planting be when will it dawn if they do not increase when will it be so therefore we will merely undo them a little now that is what is wanted because it is not good what we have found out their works will merely be equated with ours their knowledge will extend to the furthest reaches and they will see everything thus spoke heart of sky and huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt sovereign and quetzal serpent she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons xpiyacoc and xmucane the framer and the shaper as they are called thus they remade the essence of that which they had framed and shaped the creation of the mothers of the quich nation their eyes were merely blurred by heart of sky they were blinded like breath upon the face of a mirror thus their eyes were blinded they could see only nearby things were clear to them only where they were thus their knowledge was lost the wisdom of the first four people was lost there at their foundation at their beginning thus were the framing and the shaping of our first grandfathers and fathers by heart of sky and heart of earth then their companions their wives also came to be it was the gods alone who conceived them as well as if it were in their sleep they received them the women were truly beautiful who were with balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam thus when the men were brought to life their wives truly came to be as well at once their hearts rejoiced because of their mates figure 66 then their companions their wives also came to be quich women from totonicap n these then are the names of their wives cahapaluna was the name of the wife of balam quitze chomiha was the name of the wife of balam acab tzununiha was the name of the wife of mahucutah caquixaha was the name of the wife of iqui balam these therefore were the names of their wives they who came to be our rulers these were they who multiplied the nations both small and great this therefore was our foundation we the quich people there were many who came to be bloodletters and sacrificers there are no longer merely four now but four were the mothers of the quich people each of the people had different names when they multiplied there in the east truly these became the names of the people sovereign ballplayer masker and sun lord these are the titles of the people it was there in the east that they multiplied the beginning of the tamub and the ilocab is known as one they came from there in the east balam quitze was the grandfather the father of nine great houses of the cavecs balam acab was the grandfather the father of nine great houses of the nihaibs mahucutah was the grandfather the father of four great houses of ahau quich s thus there were three divisions of lineages that existed the names of their grandfathers and their fathers were not forgotten they who multiplied and proliferated there in the east the tamub and the ilocab came as well along with the thirteen allied nations the thirteen houses the rabinals the cakchiquels and the ah tziquinahas as well as the zacahs and the lamacs the cumatz and the tuhalhas the uchabahas and the ah chumilahas along with the ah quibahas and the ah batenahas the acul vinacs and the balamihas the can chahels and the balam colobs of these we shall speak only of the nations that became great among the allied nations they who became great we shall declare there were many others that came out of the citadel after them each one of them a division we have not written their names but they also multiplied there in the east many people arrived in darkness in the days of their increase for the sun was yet to be born there was no light in the days of their increase they were all as one crowded together as they walked there in the east there was no one to provide for their sustenance they would merely lift up their faces to the sky for they did not know where to go this they did for a long time there among the magueys among the black people and the white people the people of many appearances and many tongues they were destitute in their existence at the edge of the sky s foundation and there were mountain people they were hidden and without homes only among the small mountains and the great mountains did they go it is as if they were lacking in direction as they used to say it is said that in those days they quarreled with the mountain people there they looked for the coming forth of the sun when they had one common language they did not yet call upon wood or stone they remembered the word of the framer and the shaper of heart of sky and heart of earth it was said they would merely plead for their heartening their sowing and their dawning these were people of esteemed words of esteem of honor and of respect they would lift up their faces to the sky as they pleaded for their daughters and their sons alas you framer and you shaper behold us hear us do not abandon us do not allow us to be overthrown you are the god in the sky and on the earth you heart of sky heart of earth may our sign our word be given for as long as there is sun and light then may it be sown may it dawn may there be true life giving roads and pathways give us steadfast light that our nation be made steadfast may the light be favorable that our nation may be favored may our lives be favored so that all creation may be favored as well give this to us you huracan youngest thunderbolt and sudden thunderbolt youngest nanavac and sudden nanavac falcon and hunahpu sovereign and quetzal serpent she who has borne children and he who has begotten sons xpiyacoc and xmucane grandmother of day and grandmother of light then may it be sown then may it dawn they said then they fasted and cried out in prayer they fixed their eyes firmly on their dawn looking there to the east they watched closely for the morning star the great star that gives its light at the birth of the sun they looked to the womb of the sky and the womb of the earth to the pathways of framed and shaped people then spoke balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam we shall surely await the dawn they said they were great sages and wise men bloodletters and honorers as they are called there did not exist then wood or stone to watch over our first mothers and fathers they were therefore weary in their hearts as they awaited the dawn there were many nations then there with the yaqui people the bloodletters and sacrificers let us go and search to look for one who may protect us we may find one before whom we may speak for here we only feign existence and there is not a guardian for us said therefore balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam they heard news of a citadel and there they went the arrival at tulan this then is the name of the mountain that they went to balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam along with the tamub and the ilocab arrived at tulan zuyva seven caves and seven canyons was the name of the citadel there they arrived to obtain their gods figure 67 balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam arrived at tulan zuyva city surrounded by water from a mural in the temple of the warriors chichen itza drawing by ann axtell morris the progenitors receive their gods they arrived there at tulan all of them innumerable people they were when they arrived they walked in crowds when the gods came out to them in succession first among them were balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam who rejoiced figure 68 there they received their gods a highland maya god from a mural at iximche drawing by linda schele we have found that for which we have searched they said the god named tohil went out first carried in his pack frame by balam quitze then went out the god named auilix carried by balam acab next was hacavitz the name of the god received by mahucutah nicacah tacah was the name of the god received by iqui balam together with the quich people the tamub also received tohil this is the name of the god received by the grandfathers and fathers of the tamub as these lords are known today third then were the ilocab tohil was also the name of the god received by the grandfathers and fathers of the ilocab as these lords are known today the progenitors leave tulan thus was the naming of the three quich s but in this they freed themselves because it was the same god s name tohil quich for all of them it was tohil for the tamub as well as for the ilocab there was only one name for god among them therefore the three groups of quich s were not divided three were they who were truly great in their nature tohil auilix and hacavitz then all the nations entered therein the rabinals the cakchiquels and the ah tziquinahas along with the yaqui people as they are called today it was there that the languages of the nations were changed their languages came to be different they did not hear each other clearly when they came from tulan thus they split apart they came in crowds from the east they were alike in the hides that they wore as coverings for their dress was very poor they had nothing of their own but they were enchanted people in their essence when they came from tulan zuyva the seven caves and the seven canyons as they are called in the ancient account they did not have fire only tohil this was the god of the nations when fire was first created it was not clear how it was created for the fire was already burning when balam quitze and balam acab saw it alas fire has not come to be ours we shall die of cold they said then tohil spoke do not mourn the fire shall be yours again should you lose it i have spoken tohil said to them are you not truly god you are our provider and strengthener you are our god they said when they gave thanks and tohil replied very well i am truly your god then be it so i am your lord then be it so the bloodletters and sacrificers were told by tohil this therefore was the glory of the nations and they rejoiced because of their fire the nations ask for their fire then it began to rain while the fire of the nations burned brightly hail fell thickly on the heads of all the nations and their fire went out because of the hail thus their fire came to nought then balam quitze and balam acab pleaded again for their fire o tohil truly the cold has finished us they said to tohil very well do not mourn said tohil then he brought forth fire he twist drilled inside his shoe thus balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam rejoiced as they warmed themselves figure 69 then he brought forth fire he twist drilled inside his shoe a god makes new fire by means of a twist drill from the dresden codex p 6b villacorta and villacorta 1930 but the fire of the nations was extinguished and the cold had nearly finished them thus they came to plead for fire from balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam they could no longer bear it because of the cold and the hail they shuddered and trembled there was no life in them because of the shivering of their legs and their arms neither could they hold on to anything when they arrived truly we are not ashamed to come before you to ask for just a little bit of your fire they said when they arrived but they were not welcomed and the nations cursed in their hearts for now the language of balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam was different alas is our language now abandoned what have we done we are lost where were we deceived we had but one language when we came from tulan we had but one origin and creation it is not good what we have done said all the nations beneath the trees and beneath the bushes then a person revealed himself before balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam this messenger from xibalba said to them truly tohil is your god he is your provider he is also the substitute and remembrance of your framer and your shaper do not give therefore fire to the nations unless they first give something to tohil in return it is not to you that they shall give rather your desire must be to go before tohil ask him what they shall give in return for the fire said the person from xibalba he had wings like the wings of a bat i am a messenger from your framer and your shaper said the person from xibalba thus they rejoiced tohil auilix and hacavitz became great in their hearts when the person from xibalba spoke to them then suddenly he disappeared before their faces although he was not destroyed then the nations arrived the cold had nearly finished them it was thick with hail with dark storms and with hoar frost the cold was too much to be conceived all the nations covered themselves up bending over and crawling on their hands and knees because of the cold when they arrived before balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam they were greatly troubled in their hearts sorrowful were their mouths and their faces the nations are deceived into offering themselves thus they arrived as thieves before the faces of balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam truly will you not take pity on us we shall only ask for a small bit of your fire has it not been discovered has it not been found were we not of the same home we were of the same mountain when you were framed and when you were shaped take pity therefore on us they said what then will you give to us if we were to take pity on you they asked very well then we will give precious metal to you the nations replied we do not want precious metal said balam quitze and balam acab what then do you truly want we plead of you said therefore the nations very well we will first inquire of tohil then we shall tell you they were told then they asked tohil what are the nations to give o tohil asked balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam they have come to ask for your fire very well then this is what you will say do they not want to give the breast beneath their shoulders and their armpits do they not desire in their hearts to embrace me i tohil if they do not want this then i will not give to them their fire says tohil you will say to them it will have a beginning but it will not be today that they will give the breast below their shoulders and their armpits he says to you this is what you will say this is what balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam were told thus they spoke the word of tohil to the nations very well then the breast shall be given it is good that we are to embrace him they replied in this way they responded accepting the word of tohil thus they were never again to increase fine they said straightaway thus they received fire and they were warmed there was only one group that stole away the fire from within the smoke this was the zotzilaha chamal can is the name of the god of the cakchiquels his image was merely that of a bat they passed by in the smoke moving stealthily as they passed thus when they arrived to take the fire the cakchiquels did not ask for it they did not give themselves up in defeat as all the nations had done who were defeated thus the nations gave their breasts beneath their shoulders and beneath their armpits this then was the breast giving spoken of by tohil all the nations were to be sacrificed before him their hearts were to be carved out from beneath their shoulders and armpits this thing had not heretofore been attempted thus tohil foresaw the seizure of glory and majesty by balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam figure 70 all the nations were to be sacrificed before him their hearts were to be carved out from beneath their shoulders and armpits sacrifice by heart extraction from a gold disk chichen itza lothrop 1952 fig 1 copyright by the president and fellows of harvard college now when they came from tulan zuyva they did not eat they fasted continuously yet they fixed their eyes on the dawn looking steadfastly for the coming forth of the sun they occupied themselves in looking for the great star called icoquih which appears first before the birth of the sun the face of this green morning star always appears at the coming forth of the sun when they were there at the place called tulan zuyva their gods came to them but it was surely not then that they received their ultimate glory or their lordship rather it was where the great nations and the small nations were conquered and humiliated when they were sacrificed before the face of tohil they gave their blood which flowed from the shoulders and the armpits of all the people straightaway at tulan came the glory and the great knowledge that was theirs it was in the darkness in the night as well that they accomplished it thus they came they were pulled up like weeds as they came out from there leaving the east behind this is not our home surely let us go to see where we shall begin said tohil he truly spoke to balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam you shall first give thanks you shall carry out your responsibilities first by piercing your ears you shall prick your elbows this shall be your petition your way of giving thanks before the face of god figure 71 you shall carry out your responsibilities first by piercing your ears you shall prick your elbows deity holding the instruments of bloodletting from the madrid codex p 86b villacorta and villacorta 1930 very well they said then they pierced their ears they wept as they sang of their coming from tulan they wept within their hearts as they came weeping for tulan alas it is not here that we shall see the dawn when the sun will be born to illuminate the face of the earth they said as they came they merely stayed on the road the people of each of the nations remained sleeping and resting together on the road yet always they looked for the star the sign of the sun the sign of the dawn in their hearts when they came from the east they were truly united as they made their journey here passing through honor and respect as it is said today the people gather on the mountain chi pixab then they arrived atop a mountain all the quich people gathered together along with the nations there they all came and counseled one with another the mountain today is called chi pixab this is the name of the mountain here they gathered together and here they gave to one another their names i am this i am a quich person you then are this tamub your name shall come to be the tamub were told then the ilocab were addressed you are ilocab this is the name that shall come to be yours we the three quich s will not be lost for our word is one they said when their names were given their suffering on the mountain chi pixab then the cakchiquels were given their name cakchiquels came to be their name also rabinals came to be the name of that people and ah tziquinahas was the name by which that people are known today these then were the names of they who spoke together it was there that they came to await the dawn they would look for the first appearance of the star that precedes the face of the sun when it is born figure 72 they would look for the first appearance of the star that precedes the face of the sun when it is born this is the anthropomorphic god of the morning star venus descending head first from a sky band the hieroglyph for venus forms his head while the glyph for the sun rests on his right foot from the dresden codex p 58b villacorta and villacorta 1930 we came from there but we were split apart they said among themselves this is what preoccupied their hearts as they passed through their great afflictions they did not have food or sustenance they would only sniff the bottoms of their staffs to feel as if they were eating but they did not eat when they came it was not clear how they passed over the sea to come here it was as if there were no sea that they had to pass over they merely passed over on the tops of stones for there were stones on the sand thus they named it lined up stones and piled up sand was also its name over these they made their passage here from within the sea the water divided itself and through it they made their passage here they were preoccupied in their hearts when they took counsel together for they had no food they would drink only atole made of maize grains which they had borne to the top of the mountain named chi pixab they had carried only tohil auilix and hacavitz thus balam quitze observed a great fast along with his wife named cahapaluna the same also did balam acab with his wife named chomiha along with mahucutah who observed a great fast with his wife named tzununiha and also iqui balam and caquixaha which was the name of his wife thus they fasted in the darkness in the night great was their sorrow when they were atop the mountain which is called chi pixab today then spoke the gods there the progenitors await the first dawn then spoke tohil auilix and hacavitz to balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam we must go now we must rise up for we are not meant to be here place us in hiding for does not the dawn now approach would you not be pitiable if we should become the spoils of warriors make for us a place that we may be with you o bloodletters and sacrificers and place each of us there they said when they spoke to them very well let us arise and search in the forests they all said then each of them took his god to be carried on his back auilix was taken into a canyon named hidden canyon a great canyon in the forest pa auilix is its name today there he was left he was left in the canyon by balam acab he was the first to be left then hacavitz was left on top of a great fire house hacavitz is the name of the mountain today this they made their citadel and this was where the god s dwelling came to be hacavitz it was called mahucutah did not leave his god behind therefore this was the second god that was hidden by them it was not in the forest that hacavitz dwelt but rather it was on a cleared mountain where hacavitz was hidden then came balam quitze he arrived there in the great forest to hide tohil pa tohil is the name of this great mountain today then they named the hidden canyon healing tohil it was crowded with snakes as well as jaguars rattlesnakes and pit vipers there in the forest they were hidden by the bloodletters and sacrificers they were as one balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam as one they awaited the dawn there on top of the mountain called hacavitz nearby was the god of the tamub along with the god of the ilocab amac tan was the name of the place where the god of the tamub was there it dawned amac uquincat was the name of the place where the ilocab dawned the god of the ilocab was there on a nearby mountain there all the rabinals the cakchiquels and the ah tziquinahas all the small nations and the great nations arose as one there was but one dawn as one they awaited the coming forth of the great star named icoquih first it will come forth before the face of the sun then it shall dawn they said they were as one balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam they did not sleep they did not rest greatly did they weep in their hearts in their bowels for the dawn and for clarity they came there surely as penitents in great sorrow and great humility they trembled because of the afflictions that they had passed through our coming has not been sweet alas would that we could behold the birth of the sun what have we done we were united in our mountains but our natures have been changed they said they spoke a great deal among themselves concerning their sorrow their humility and their fervent prayers thus they spoke for their hearts had yet to be comforted in the dawn but these the gods were comforted in the canyons and the forests they were placed in bromelia flowers and hanging moss rather than on altars tohil auilix and hacavitz spoke from the first great was their day their breath and their spirit above all the gods of the nations manifold were their spirit essences their pathways and their victorious means of chilling and frightening the very existence and hearts of the nations figure 73 but these the gods were comforted in the canyons and the forests they were placed in bromelia flowers and hanging moss rather than on altars stone deity image in the forested mountains near chichicastenango the deity is surrounded by a rough stone enclosure filled with offerings of flower petals candles and other offerings balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam gave comfort to the gods they were not unhappy nor did they bear ill will in their hearts for the gods that they had carried these they had carried when they came from tulan zuyva there in the east but they were in the forest there was the place of dawning on pa tohil pa auilix and pa hacavitz as they are called today it was there that our grandfathers and fathers were sown when they dawned now we shall tell of the dawning and the appearance of the sun moon and stars the appearance of the first dawn this therefore is the dawn the appearance of the sun moon and stars greatly they rejoiced balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam when they saw the morning star it came forth glittering before the face of the sun then they unwrapped their copal incense for the sun was to come forth they unwrapped it with victory in their hearts there were three types of incense that they burned as a means of expressing the gratitude in their hearts mixtam incense was the name of the copal incense carried by balam quitze caviztan incense was the name of the copal incense carried by balam acab and cabavil incense as it is called was carried by mahucutah these three were the copal incenses that they burned waving their censers toward the rising sun they wept bitterly as they waved their censers burning the sacred copal incense before they saw and witnessed the birth of the sun and when the sun came forth all the small animals and great animals rejoiced they came up from the rivers and from the canyons they were there on the mountain peak as one they turned their faces toward the coming forth of the sun then the pumas and the jaguars cried out the first bird to sing was the parrot as it is called all the animals truly rejoiced the eagles and the white vultures all the small and great birds spread their wings the bloodletters and sacrificers were kneeling they greatly rejoiced along with the bloodletters and sacrificers of the tamub and the ilocab along with the rabinals and the cakchiquels the ah tziquinahas and the tuhalhas the uchabahas and the quibahas the ah batenas and the yaqui tepeus however many nations there are today innumerable people they all had but one dawn then also the face of the earth was dried by the sun like a person was the sun when he revealed himself hot was his face and thus he dried the surface of the earth before the sun had come forth the face of the earth was wet it was soggy prior to the coming forth of the sun but when the sun ascended upward he was like a person his heat could not be endured this was but his self revelation when he was born what is left is but a mirror what appears now is not the true sun according to their account figure 74 like a person was the sun when he revealed himself sun deity from a mural at chichen itza drawing by linda schele then straightaway tohil auilix and hacavitz became stone along with the sacred images of the puma and the jaguar the rattlesnake and the pit viper zaqui coxol took them and hid himself in the trees when the sun moon and stars appeared they all turned to stone perhaps we would not be alive today because of the vicious animals the puma and the jaguar the rattlesnake and the pit viper as well as zaqui coxol it would not be our day if the sun had not come forth and turned the first animals to stone figure 75 zaqui coxol took them and hid himself in the trees a dancer dressed as coxol momostenango photograph by garrett cook great was the joy in the hearts of balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam when it dawned there were not many people then there were only a few on top of the mountain of hacavitz there they dawned and there they burned incense waving their censers toward the coming forth of the sun this was their mountain their plain there came they who are named balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam there they multiplied on the top of the mountain that was to become their citadel there it was that the sun moon and stars truly appeared everything on the face of the earth and beneath the sky had its dawn and became clear thus began their song called our burial their hearts and bowels wept as they sang and this is what they said in their song alas we were lost at tulan we split ourselves apart we left behind our older brothers and our younger brothers where did they see the sun where were they when it dawned this they sang concerning the bloodletters and sacrificers of the yaqui people tohil is the god of the yaqui people who they call yolcuat quitzalcuat we were separated there at tulan zuyva we left them to come here but we were complete before we came here this they said among themselves when they remembered their older brothers and their younger brothers the yaqui people these dawned there in mexico as it is called today thus surely a portion of them remained there in the east they whose names are tepeu and oliman we left them behind they said thus they were greatly troubled in their hearts there on top of hacavitz the tamub and the ilocab felt the same they whose name was amac tan were merely in the forest when the bloodletters and sacrificers of the tamub dawned with their god tohil is the sole name for the god of the three groups of quich people this is also the name for the god of the rabinals only a little bit different is his name one toh being the name of the god of the rabinals they say it this way because of their desire to make it one with the language of the quich s there the language of the cakchiquels was changed for when they came from tulan zuyva the name of their god was chimalcan this was the god received by the bat house people along with their god this lineage also received their titles ahpo zotzil and ahpo xahil they are called this god changed their speech when he was received there at tulan it was a stone that was the cause of the change in their speech when they came from tulan in the darkness yet all the nations were sown as one when the names of the gods were given to each of the groups we shall now tell of their residence their sojourn there on the top of the mountain they were as one the four of them balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam their hearts cried out to tohil auilix and hacavitz who were amidst the bromelia flowers and the hanging moss offerings are made to the gods these then are the burnings and the offerings placed beneath tohil when they went before the faces of tohil and auilix they went there to see them and to worship them they gave thanks before them for the dawn they knelt humbly with heads bowed low before the stones there in the forest figure 76 they knelt humbly with heads bowed low before the stones there in the forest quich women burn an offering before a stone deity image near chichicastenango it was only the revelation of the god s spirit essence that spoke when the bloodletters and sacrificers arrived before the face of tohil what they carried was not great nor were their burnt offerings it was only pine resin the remnants of pitch along with peric n flowers that they burned before the face of their god then spoke tohil it was only his spirit essence that gave knowledge to the bloodletters and sacrificers then the gods spoke figure 77 set the skins of the deer aside and watch over them deer skins used in rituals conserved in a ceremonial house santiago atitl n it is here that our mountain and our plain shall be we have come to be yours great is our day great as well is our birth because of all your people and all the nations we shall surely be your companions then your citadel we shall give to you your knowledge do not reveal us before the nations when they come up to us for truly they shall become many thus do not let them set traps for us but give to us the children of the grasses and the fallen grain bring to us a little of the blood of the female deer and the female bird take pity on us set the skins of the deer aside and watch over them these shall be a means of concealing identity the deer will become the means by which you shall deceive them these will surely be our substitutes before the faces of the nations when you are asked where is tohil it will be this deerskin bundle that you shall show them but do not reveal yourselves do this now and your existence shall become great you shall conquer all the nations they must bring to you their blood their flowing blood shall be brought before our faces let them come to us and embrace us they are ours now said tohil auilix and hacavitz figure 78 when you are asked where is tohil it will be this deerskin bundle that you shall show them deity holding torches hovers over a sacrificed deer from the dresden codex p 45c villacorta and villacorta 1930 the gods would appear as boys when they were seen when offerings were burned before their faces thus they began to seek out the offspring of birds and deer which were taken and offered by the bloodletters and the sacrificers they would find the birds and the young deer and go to place their blood in the mouths of the stones tohil and auilix drank this therefore it was the bloody drink of the gods straightaway then the stones spoke when the bloodletters and sacrificers came to give their burnt offerings they did the same before the deerskin bundles they would burn pine resin peric n flowers and stevia flowers there was a deer skin bundle for each of them on the tops of the mountains the dwellings and the homes of our ancestors were not in the sun they walked only in the mountains and this is what they would eat only hornet larvae only wasp larvae only bee larvae would they seek at first they did not have good food or water the pathway leading to their homes was not clear nor was it clear where their wives dwelt the other nations were crowded together all of them would unite joining together with one another they would raise a din there on the roads their paths were clear but it was not clear where balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam were when they would see the nations passing by on the roads they would cry out on the peaks of mountains they would cry out with the call of the coyote and the call of the fox they would make the call of the puma and the jaguar and when the nations heard this there was great discussion about it this is merely the cry of the coyote and of the fox said the nations it is merely the puma and the jaguar the nations said the nations did not realize that these were people it was merely a way of deceiving the nations that this was done it was not the desire of their hearts to truly frighten them thus they would make the call of a puma or jaguar and then when they would see one or two people out walking it would be their desire to destroy them each day they arrived at their homes with their wives bearing only hornet larvae wasp larvae and bee larvae and each day also they went before tohil auilix and hacavitz saying in their hearts we give merely the blood of deer and birds to tohil auilix and hacavitz we merely prick our ears and our elbows we plead for our strength and our endurance to tohil auilix and hacavitz who shall be responsible for the death of the nations shall we kill them only one at a time this they said to each other when they went before tohil auilix and hacavitz then they pierced their ears and their elbows before the faces of their gods they scooped up their blood and rubbed it inside the mouths of the stones yet they had not truly become stones each of them appeared as young boys when they came they rejoiced for the blood of the bloodletters and sacrificers then came the sign of their deeds conquer many lands this is your authority it came from tulan when you brought us here they were told then was given the breast at the place called pa zilizib and behind it came blood a rain of their blood as an offering for tohil along with auilix and hacavitz the sacrificial killings begin this is the beginning of the abduction of people from the nations by balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam then also was the killing of the nations they were taken in this way only one would go out walking or two would go out walking it was not clear how they were taken then they would be taken to be sacrificed before the faces of tohil and auilix afterward their blood and skulls would be placed on the road thus the nations would say a jaguar ate them this they would say because only the tracks of a jaguar were left behind they would not reveal themselves many were abducted from the nations until after a long time the nations came to their senses perhaps tohil and auilix have come after us we shall merely seek out the bloodletters and the sacrificers let us follow their footprints when they go to their homes the nations all said when they planned among themselves thus they began to follow the footprints of the bloodletters and the sacrificers but they were not clear they were only deer tracks and jaguar tracks that they would see their footprints were not clear nowhere was it clear where the tracks began their footprints were just like the pawprints of animals it was merely confusion for them neither was the pathway clear none of the nations could see because there would form clouds there would form dark rain there would form mud and there would form drizzling rain thus they would weary their hearts searching they would mourn for great was the essence of tohil auilix and hacavitz thus this was done for a long time atop the mountain on the borders of the nations they would kill them when the abductions began these were murderous assaults when they would seize the people of the nations on the roads they would then sacrifice them before the faces of tohil auilix and hacavitz thus the boys were preserved there on the top of the mountain tohil auilix and hacavitz had the appearance of three boys when they went out walking these were the spirit essences of the stones there was a river where they would bathe along the banks as a way of revealing themselves and this was what gave it its name bath of tohil became the name of the river many times the nations would see them but then suddenly they would vanish when the people of the nations saw this they would report where balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam could be found thus the nations plotted how to kill them the nations plot to seduce the gods above all else the nations desired to plan for the defeat of tohil auilix and hacavitz all the bloodletters and sacrificers spoke before the nations they assembled themselves together summoning all of them not one group nor two groups were left behind all of them gathered together summoning one another then they gathered their thoughts they spoke asking one another what would ensure the defeat of the cavec quich people for the children of our mothers and the sons of our men are finished it is not clear how they caused the loss of these people but if these abductions continue we shall be finished if tohil auilix and hacavitz are to become great and glorious then tohil shall come to be our god but we shall be preeminent they will not succeed in defeating us are our people not many and these the cavec are there not but few of them this they asked when they all came together then some of them spoke before the nations who perhaps are they that bathe by the banks of the river each day if they are tohil auilix and hacavitz then we shall surely defeat them first thus shall begin the defeat of the bloodletters and the sacrificers they said then they inquired how then will we defeat them they asked this shall be our means of defeating them because the boys appear at the river let two maidens go there that are truly chosen they should be the fairest of maidens thus may they be objects of desire for them they said very well then we shall search for two of the best maidens they said and so they sought among their daughters for the truly fairest of maidens then they instructed these maidens go our daughters to wash clothes at the river if then you see the three boys undress yourselves before their faces and if their hearts should desire you then you shall offer yourselves to them when they shall say to you we shall come unto you then you shall say yes when you are petitioned when they ask where do you come from whose daughters are you then you shall reply we are the daughters of lords then they will give something to you if they should desire you and if so then you shall surely give yourselves to them if you do not give yourselves to them then we will kill you but our hearts will be content when you bring their sign here this therefore will be a sign to our hearts that they have come unto you thus said the lords when they instructed the maidens these then were the names of the two lady lust and lady weeping there were two of them lady lust and lady weeping were their names these were sent there to the river to the bath of tohil auilix and hacavitz this was the plan of all of these nations the seduction of lady lust and lady wailing then they went they were adorned in finery and truly they appeared beautiful when they went there to the place where tohil bathes they carried their wash on their heads as they went thus the lords rejoiced because of their two daughters that they had sent there and when they arrived at the river they began to wash each of them undressed herself and got down on her hands and knees before the stones figure 79 and when they arrived at the river they began to wash quich women washing clothes near momostenango then tohil auilix and hacavitz came together they arrived there on the bank of the river but they paid little attention to the two maidens that were washing straightaway therefore the maidens were ashamed when tohil arrived tohil did not desire the two maidens then they inquired where do you come from they asked the two maidens what do you want by coming here to the bank of our river they were asked we were sent here by the lords therefore we came go to see the faces of tohil and speak with them the lords said to us thus may you receive a sign that you truly saw their faces we were told this is what the two maidens said when they explained their mission this then had been the desire of the nations that the maidens be violated by the spirit essence of tohil thus said tohil auilix and hacavitz when they spoke to lady lust and lady weeping the names of the two maidens it is good that you should take the sign of our word with you you shall wait for it and give it to the lords they were told thus they counseled with the bloodletters and sacrificers they spoke with balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam paint three robes writing upon them your essence they shall be taken to the nations by means of the two maidens who are washing give these to them balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah were told the nations are defeated by the painted robes thus the three of them painted first balam quitze painted the image of what came to be a jaguar he painted it on the face of the robe next balam acab painted the image of an eagle then mahucutah painted hornets all over it everywhere he painted the images of wasps on the face of the robe thus the three of them finished their paintings three forms they painted on the robes and gave them to lady lust and lady weeping as they are called then said balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah this is the sign of your word you shall go before the faces of the lords and say truly tohil spoke to us you shall say this then is the sign we have brought you shall say to them then they will wear the robes that you will give to them in this way were the maidens instructed so then they returned carrying the painted robes and when they arrived straightaway the lords rejoiced when they saw their faces and that which was draped across their arms thus the maidens were entreated did you not see the face of tohil they were asked we did see him replied lady lust and lady weeping very well then where is the sign that you have brought is it not true the lords asked for the lords felt it was the sign of their disgrace thus the maidens untied the painted robes everywhere there were jaguars everywhere eagles and everywhere hornets and wasps the paintings inside the robes shone brightly thus they desired the faces of the robes and put them on about them the image of the jaguar did nothing at first around the lord then another lord put on the second painted robe with the image of the eagle the lord felt good inside it he turned about before them he opened up his robe before them all then another lord put on the third painted robe with the hornets and wasps inside and when he put it around him he was stung by the hornets and wasps he could not bear it he could not endure the stinging insects thus he cried out because of the painted images of the insects within the robe this was the painting of mahucutah the third of the paintings and thus they were defeated then the lords rebuked the maidens they who were named lady lust and lady weeping what are these robes that you have brought here where did you go to get them you are deceivers thus the maidens were asked when they were rebuked thus all of the nations were defeated by tohil they had desired that tohil would get gratification from lady lust and lady weeping but these then became seductresses they came to be temptations to the heart of the nations thus the nations did not achieve the defeat of the enchanted people balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah then all the nations considered again how can we do it truly great their natures have come to be they said then they gathered their thoughts we shall merely pursue them and kill them we shall arm ourselves with arrows and with shields are we not many there shall not be even one or two left of them they said when they gathered their thoughts thus all the nations armed themselves they were crowded with killers when all the nations gathered they were killers now balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam were on the top of the mountain hacavitz this was the name of the mountain where they were thus their sons were established on the top of the mountain they were not many then they were certainly not as numerous at first as the people from the nations they occupied only a small part of the mountain top thus the nations plotted to kill them they all gathered together they arrived all of them having been summoned the nations are humiliated thus all the nations gathered together they were all armed with arrows and shields their precious metal adornments were innumerable all of the lords and warriors were beautiful in their appearance but in fact they were mere boasters all of them truly they would all come to be enslaved figure 80 they were all armed with arrows and shields their precious metal adornments were innumerable all of the lords and warriors were beautiful in their appearance warriors preparing for battle from a wall panel chichen itza drawing by linda schele this tohil he is a god we also shall worship him but we shall capture him they said among themselves but tohil learned of it and so too did balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah they heard what was being planned they did not sleep nor did they rest thus all the warriors had adorned themselves they rose up in the night with confidence in their hearts but although they went out they did not reach their destination all the warriors merely slept in the road then was their defeat by balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah they merely slept in the road completely senseless all of them were exhausted with sleep then they began to have their eyebrows plucked along with their whiskers the precious metal was untied from their clothing as well as from their headdresses and their necklaces the precious metal was taken from the necks of their staffs this was a punishment upon their faces and a plucking as well this was done as a sign of the greatness of the quich people and when they arose straightaway they reached for their headdresses and the necks of their staffs but now there was no precious metal on the necks of their staffs nor on their headdresses who has taken us by whom were we plucked where did they who stole our precious metal come from all the warriors asked perhaps it was those deceivers that abduct people but they will not succeed in frightening us surely we shall invade their citadel we shall see again the face of our precious metal and once more make it ours said all the nations but this was merely boasting thus the hearts of the bloodletters and sacrificers were comforted on the top of the mountain balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam merely exercised their wisdom then balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam considered they made a palisade around the edge of their citadel they placed wooden planks and pointed stakes about their citadel then they made effigies that looked just like people they arranged these on top of the palisade arming them with shields and with arrows they placed headdresses with precious metal on their heads they adorned these effigies of mere carved wood with the precious metal of the nations that they had taken on the road with these they encircled the citadel then also they entreated tohil with their thoughts what if we should die what if we are defeated they asked thus their hearts wept before the face of tohil do not mourn i am you shall use these against them do not fear thus he spoke to balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam and they were given the hornets and wasps so they went out to gather them and they returned bearing them and these they placed inside four great gourds which they positioned in four places around the edge of the citadel the hornets and wasps were closed up within the great gourds they used these as weapons against the nations figure 81 and they were given the hornets and wasps a wasp from the madrid codex p 105b villacorta and villacorta 1930 the citadel was being spied upon watched in ambush scrutinized as a target by the messengers of the nations there are not so many they said and then they saw the effigies of carved wood which were motionless carrying their arrows and their shields they appeared to be true people like killers they appeared to be when the nations saw them all the nations rejoiced then for they did not see many of them but there were crowds of people from the nations their people had countless warriors killers and murderers that had come against balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah who were on top of the mountain named hacavitz we shall now speak of this invasion the nations are defeated there they were balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam united on top of the mountain with their wives and their children then came the warriors and the killers there were not merely sixteen thousand or twenty four thousand from the nations that encircled the citadel they yelled armed with their arrows and shields they would cry out clamoring hustling about shouting their mockery and whistling but the bloodletters and sacrificers went inside beneath their citadel fearing nothing they merely looked to the palisade at the edge of their citadel as they gathered together with their wives and their children thus they were reassured and the words of the nations were sweet to them then the warriors ascended a little way up the face of the mountain but it was only a little way for they did not reach the entrance to the citadel and then they opened the four gourds that were in the citadel and out flew the hornets and the wasps they were like clouds of smoke when they came out of each of the gourds the warriors were thus finished off because of the insects they landed on their eyes and on their noses on their mouths on their legs and on their arms wherever they were the hornets and wasps went to catch them wherever they were these went to swarm around them everwhere there were hornets and wasps they would swarm around them stinging their eyes there were great numbers of insects around each of the people thus they became disoriented because of the hornets and the wasps neither could they now grasp their arrows or their shields they hunched over with their faces to their knees on the surface of the ground they were scattered they fell senseless before the face of the mountain then they were struck with arrows and chopped with axes although they were only pieces of dry wood that balam quitze and balam acab used on them their wives also came upon them as killers thus only a portion of them were able to return only a few people from the nations were able to escape at first they tried to flee but when they were caught they were finished off they were killed and it was not just a few of the people who died and of those that did not die the insects came upon them and tormented their hearts they were no longer able to wage war they did not take up their arrows or their shields again thus all the nations were humiliated and begged humbly before the faces of balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah pity us do not kill us they said very well then certainly you shall become obedient you shall be servants as long as there is sun and light they were told thus was the defeat of all the nations because of our first mothers and our first fathers it was done on the top of the mountain hacavitz as it is called today this was the beginning there they multiplied and became many they had daughters and they had sons on top of hacavitz they rejoiced then for they had defeated all the nations there on top of the mountain thus they had done this they had surely defeated the nations indeed all the nations thus their hearts were reassured they spoke to their sons as the time approached when they would die for they truly desired to die now we shall tell of this also of the deaths of they who are called balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam the deaths of the four progenitors they sensed their impending death and disappearance thus they gave instructions to their sons they were not ill nor did they groan from sickness nor did they breathe with difficulty yet they left behind their word with their sons these then are the names of the sons balam quitze had two sons co caib was the name of the firstborn and co cavib was the name of the secondborn these were the sons of balam quitze the grandfather and father of the cavecs balam acab of the nihaibs also had two sons co acul was the name of his first son and co acutec was the name of his second son mahucutah had only one son whose name was co ahau these three had sons but iqui balam had no sons these then were the names of their sons who were true bloodletters and sacrificers the four of them were united as they sang of the pain in their hearts their hearts wept within their song our burial was the name of the song that they sang and these were the instructions that they gave to their sons you our sons we shall go but we shall also return again words of light and counsels of light we give to you and then they spoke to their wives you have come here from a far away mountain you our wives they said then they were counseled we go to our people our lord deer is now established mirrored in the sky we shall thus return for our work is accomplished and our day is now finished remember us do not forget us do not sweep us away you shall surely see your homes and your mountains where you will settle thus let it be so go therefore go to see the place from whence we came this was the counsel they were given then they left behind the sign of the existence of balam quitze this is the token of my memory that i shall leave with you this is your glory these are my instructions the result of what i have pondered he said when he left behind the sign of his existence bundled glory it was called its contents were not clear for it was truly bundled they did not unwrap it nor was its stitching clear no one had seen it when it was bundled figure 82 this is the token of my memory that i shall leave with you this is your glory bundled glory it was called a highland maya priest ritually dancing a sacred ancestral bundle in a ceremonial house santiago atitl n this then was their counsel when they disappeared there atop the mountain hacavitz they were not buried by their wives nor their children neither was their disappearance clear when they vanished but their counsel was clear thus the bundle came to be precious to them as a memorial to their father straightaway they burned offerings before it as a memorial to their father thus the people were established by the lords following this beginning by balam quitze the grandfather and father of the cavecs his sons named co caib and co cavib were not lost thus were the deaths of our four grandfathers and fathers when they disappeared when they left their sons there on top of the mountain hacavitz these sons tarried there but the day of all the nations had fallen and they were humiliated and lacking in power the people had become numerous by then and all of them gathered together each day to remember their father the bundle was precious to them they did not open it it remained bundled bundled glory they called it when it existed they also named it their wrapping it had been left behind by their fathers as the true sign of their existence thus was the disappearance and end of balam quitze balam acab mahucutah and iqui balam the first people who came from across the sea in the east anciently they came here they died in their old age they who were called bloodletters and sacrificers the sons of the progenitors journey to tulan then they remembered in their hearts the journey they were to make there to the east they remembered the instructions given by their fathers who had died long ago the nations had since given wives to them thus becoming their fathers in law thus the three of them had married women and they said when they left we go to the east from where our fathers came thus said the three sons when they began their journey co caib was the name of the first the son of balam quitze of the cavecs co acutec was the name of the son of balam acab of the nihaibs co ahau was the name of the other the son of mahucutah of the ahau quich s these then were the names of the three who went across the sea they had wisdom and knowledge they were more than ordinary people in their nature they left behind their counsel to all their older brothers and their younger brothers they rejoiced when they left we will not die we will return they said when the three of them left thus they passed over the sea arriving there in the east they went there to receive their lordship this then is the name of the lord the lord of the east when they arrived the sons receive authority to rule then they arrived before the face of the lord whose name was nacxit he was the only judge over a great dominion he then gave to them the signs and symbols of their lordship thus they received the signs of office for the ah pop and the ah pop of the reception house they received the signs of their glory and lordship that pertained to the offices of ah pop and ah pop of the reception house these then are the names of the tokens of their glory and lordship figure 83 they received the signs of their glory and lordship that pertained to the offices of ah pop and ah pop of the reception house a quich lord adorned with the tokens of rulership redrawn from a mural at the ancient quich capital cumarcah drawing by k kurbjuhn and dwight t wallace in carmack 1981 297 canopy and throne bone flute and drum shining black powder and yellow stone puma paws and jaguar paws head and hooves of the deer arm band and snailshell rattle tobacco gourd and food bowl macaw feathers and snowy egret feathers all these they brought when they returned they also brought the writings of tulan from the other side of the sea these were the writings as they were called that contained the many things with which they had been invested the migrations of the quich s and when they arrived there atop their citadel called hacavitz they gathered all the tamub and ilocab together all the nations rejoiced when co caib co acutec and co ahau arrived these alone received the lordship of the nations the rabinals the cakchiquels and the ah tziquinahas rejoiced when the sign of the greatness of their lordship was revealed to them great then would become the essence of the nations for their lordship was not truly complete when they were at hacavitz when they were on top of the mountain the only people there were those who had come from the east but now there were many of them by then the wives of balam quitze balam acab and mahucutah had died then they left they abandoned their mountain and searched for another mountain to settle they settled innumerable mountains giving each of them honorific epithets and names our first mothers and fathers gathered together and became strong according to what the ancient people say thus they abandoned their first citadel called hacavitz thus they arrived they founded a new citadel called chi quix here they spent a great deal of time atop this unified citadel group they had daughters and sons when they were there although they were on four mountains there was only one name for the entire citadel they gave away their daughters in marriage to their sons they gave away their daughters merely as an act of compassion as gifts without payment in return they did only that which was good then they passed through each division of the citadel these were the names of the mountains of chi quix where they tarried chi chac humetaha culba and cavinal then they investigated the mountains near their citadel they looked for a mountain on which to dwell for they had become numerous they who had received lordship in the east were now dead they who had come to the peaks of each citadel had become aged grandfathers but they were not content they passed through numerous afflictions and misfortunes until at last they discovered the citadel of the grandfathers and the fathers this therefore was the name of the citadel that they came to the foundation of chi izmachi chi izmachi then was the name of the mountain on which they dwelt as their citadel there they settled and tested their glory they ground their lime plaster and their whitewash in the fourth generation of lords it is said that co nache and beleheb queh ruled then along with the lord magistrate figure 84 chi izmachi then was the name of the mountain on which they dwelt as their citadel view of the hill on which the ruins of chi izmachi are located it was there at chi izmachi that lord co tuha and iztayul ruled as ah pop and ah pop of the reception house under them it came to be a very fine citadel only three great houses were built there at chi izmachi not the twenty four great houses of today yet there were three great houses just one great house of the cavecs just one great house over the nihaibs and just one of the ahau quich s there were only two swollen great houses one each for the two lineage divisions at chi izmachi their hearts were united there were no bad feelings or anger only steadfast lordship there was no contention or disturbance there was only purity and a tranquil sense of community in their hearts there was no envy or jealousy yet their glory was still meager they had not pulled together nor had they become great they attempted to strengthen their defenses there at chi izmachi this act was surely a sign of their sovereignty it was surely a sign of their glory as well as their greatness however this was seen by the ilocab who fomented war they desired that lord co tuha be murdered they desired that there be but one lord over them thus the ilocab wished to convince lord iztayul to murder him but this plot against lord co tuha did not succeed their envy merely fell on their own backs this first attempt by the ilocab to kill the lord failed yet it was the foundation of strife and the clamor for war thus the ilocab made a first attempt at invading the citadel coming as killers it was their desire that the quich s be destroyed they wished to exercise lordship in their own hearts but when they came to seize it they were captured and despoiled and few of them were ever set free again then began the sacrifices the ilocab were sacrificed before the face of the god as payment for their offenses against lord co tuha thus many were taken into captivity and enslaved they became servants they merely gave themselves up in defeat as a result of their clamor for war against the lord as well as his canyon citadel they had desired in their hearts to ruin and mock the lordship of the quich s but this was not accomplished thus they commenced to sacrifice these people before the face of the god then they built their war defenses and this was the beginning of the fortification of the citadel at chi izmachi thus they began to lay the foundation of their glory because the sovereignty of the quich lord was surely great everywhere there were enchanted lords none came to humiliate or mock them they were but workers of greatness there they put down roots at chi izmachi and there also their bloodletting god increased in greatness and all the nations the small and the great became afraid they witnessed the arrival of captive people to be sacrificed and killed by the glory and sovereignty of lord co tuha and lord iztayul in alliance with the nihaib and ahau quich s there were only three divisions of lineages there at the citadel named chi izmachi and yet again they began to feast and to drink to their daughters they who were called the three great houses gathered together to celebrate they would drink their drinks and eat their food and this alone was the bride price for their sisters and their daughters there was only joy in their hearts when they feasted within their great houses we give only our thanks and our gratitude as a sign of our agreement as a sign of our word regarding the boys and girls born of their mothers they said they gave one another honorific titles and gave names to their lineages their seven nations their fortified cities we have intermarried we the cavecs we the nihaibs and we the ahau quich s they said these three lineages and these three great houses dwelt a long time there at chi izmachi but then they looked for and found another citadel and so they abandoned the peak of chi izmachi the foundation of cumarcah thus they rose up again and came to the citadel that the quich s would call cumarcah the lord co tuha along with cucumatz and all the lords came there there had been five moves and five generations of people since the beginning of the light the beginning of the nations the beginning of life and creation there they built many homes they also built houses for the gods at the center on the highest point of the citadel figure 85 thus they rose up again and came to the citadel that the quich s would call cumarcah view of the ruins of cumarcah the ruins of the temple of tohil may be seen on the far left thus they came and began to be great in their lordship they were many now crowded together they planned their great houses they gathered together and yet they were also divided because there began to be contention they began to envy each other regarding the bride price for their sisters and their daughters for it was no longer merely food and drink that they demanded this then was the root of their division they turned on each other desecrating the bones and the skulls of the dead they became infuriated with one another and split apart thus there came to be nine lineage divisions because of this contention over the sisters and the daughters therefore when lordship was conceived twenty four great houses came to be when they arrived in ancient times at the top of their citadel they completed twenty four great houses there in the citadel of cumarcah this citadel was blessed by the lord bishop after it was left abandoned they were advanced in rank differentiated by their benches and their cushions they were set apart each according to their glory each of the lords of the nine lineages was distinguished by rank nine lords of the cavecs nine lords of the nihaibs four lords of the ahau quich s and two of the ahau zaquics thus they came to be numerous many there were behind each of the lords from the beginning they were the heads of numerous vassals and servants each of the lineages of lords became crowded we shall now give the titles of each of the lords and of each of their great houses the titles of the cavec lords these then are the titles of the lords over the cavecs the first lords are ah pop and ah pop of the reception house ah tohil and ah cucumatz great steward of the cavecs and councilor of the stacks emissary of the deer house councilor in the ballcourt of punishment and mother of the reception house these then are the lords over the cavecs there are nine lords for each of the great houses and these shall now be shown the titles of the nihaib lords these then are the lords over the nihaibs the first lords are lord magistrate and lord herald magistrate of the reception house and great reception house mother of the reception house and great steward of the nihaibs auilix yacolatam corner of the reed mat zaclatol and great emissary of the sprout giver nine then were the lords of the nihaibs the titles of the ahau quich lords these then are the titles of the lords of the ahau quich s herald person and lord emissary great lord steward of the ahau quich s and lord hacavitz these are the four lords over the ahau quich s these are the great houses the titles of the zaquic lords there are also two lineages of zaquic lords maize flower house and magistrate of the zaquics there is only one house for the two lords the glory of the lords of cumarcah thus were established the twenty four lords as well as the twenty four great houses then their glory and their sovereignty were increased in quich the grandeur and importance of the quich s was glorified and made sovereign then as well the canyon citadel was whitewashed and plastered the nations came there the small and the great thus the lord who made quich great has his name figure 86 then as well the canyon citadel was whitewashed and plastered model of the site of iximche a well preserved highland maya site contemporary with cumarcah then were created their glory and their sovereignty then they created the homes of their gods as well as the homes of the lords but they themselves did not do it nor did they work to build their homes or the homes of their gods instead it was their vassals and their servants who had become numerous they did not need to lure them or abduct them or carry them off by force for they truly belonged to each one of the lords this place also came to be crowded with the lords older brothers and younger brothers the lords were ever solicitous each of them receiving numerous petitions they were truly beloved great was the authority of the lords the birthdays of the lords were honored and respected by their vassals and servants thus they multiplied there in the canyon citadel yet they were still not as many as those who fell under submission from among the nations even when war came upon their canyon and their citadel they were glorified because of the spirit essence of their lords lord cucumatz and lord co tuha cucumatz became a truly enchanted lord in one transformation he would rise up into the sky and in another transformation he would go down to xibalba in another transformation he would be a serpent truly becoming a serpent in another transformation he would make himself into an eagle and in another transformation into a jaguar truly his appearance would be that of an eagle and of a jaguar in another transformation he would become a pool of blood mere pooled blood he would become truly he was an enchanted lord in his essence figure 87 in another transformation he would make himself into an eagle lord transformed into an eagle redrawn from a gold disk discovered at chichen itza lothrop 1952 fig 41 copyright by the president and fellows of harvard college thus all the lords were frightened before his face tales about him were quickly spread abroad and all the lords of the nations heard of the nature of this enchanted lord this then was the beginning of the increase of the quich s lord cucumatz founded the grandeur of his descendents the faces of his grandchildren and his sons were not lost in his heart he did not do this so that he would be the sole lord but his nature was enchanted and thus he toppled all the lords of the nations this he did merely to reveal himself yet because of it he became the head of the nations the enchanted lord named cucumatz was of the fourth generation of lords he alone was both ah pop and ah pop of the reception house he left behind his heritage for his descendents for they became glorious and sovereigns as well and then they begat sons even their own sons making them numerous thus were begotten tepepul and iztayul these exercised true lordship they were the fifth generation of lords that came to be they begat sons as well each a generation of lords the victories of lord quicab these then are the names of the sixth generation of lords there were two great and glorious lords quicab was the name of the first lord and cauizimah was the name of the other these accomplished a great many deeds they made the quich s great for their essence was truly enchanted they broke apart and shattered the canyons and the citadels of the small nations and the great nations anciently these citadels were close together the mountain of the cakchiquels was where chuvila is today the mountain of the rabinals was pa maca the mountain of the caocs was zaccabaha the citadels then of the zaculeus were chuvi miquina xelahu chuva tzac and tzoloh che figure 88 view of the valley of chuvi miquina present day totonicap n figure 89 view of the hills above chuva tzac present day momostenango these all paid homage to quicab they had made war but they were broken apart the canyons and citadels of the rabinals the cakchiquels and the zaculeus were shattered all the nations collapsed and were split apart yet for a great while quicab s warriors persisted there were not then even one or two groups among the nations that did not bring their tribute their citadels fell and they brought tribute before quicab and cauizimah these lords invaded the lineages who were bled and shot while bound to wooden posts their day came to nothing nor did they ever have descendents it was merely arrows that were the means of shattering the citadels straightaway the mouth of the earth would be split open and thunder would shatter the stones thus the nations would suddenly become frightened and make offerings before the pine resin tree this has become a sign for the citadels for today there is a mountain of stones only a few of which were not cut cleanly as if cut by an axe it is there in the plain called petatayub where it may be clearly seen by all the people who pass by it this is the sign of the war prowess of quicab he was not killed nor was he defeated he was truly a warrior and he received tribute from all the nations then all of the lords planned sending blockaders around the canyons and around the citadels all the fallen citadels of the nations the quich s garrison the conquered regions thus the sentinels went forth as lookouts against enemy warriors they became the lineage of watchmen guardians of the mountains if the nations come again these will be the guardians it was said then all the lords gathered their thoughts and sent out their orders they shall be as our stockade as the representatives of our lineage as our fortress they shall become our palisade the expression of our anger our prowess in war said all the lords then the orders were sent out to each of the lineages who were to oppose the enemy warriors they instructed all of them who were to be sent as guardians of their mountain nations go for these are our mountains now do not fear if there are still warriors that attack you or kill you come at once to notify us and we shall go and kill them thus spoke quicab along with the magistrate and the herald by way of instruction and so they went to put the notch of the arrow to the center of the bowstring as it is said thus the grandfathers and fathers came to be separated all the quich people were placed each of them on a mountain as guardians they were guardians of arrows and bowstrings they went as guardians against war thus they did not have a single dawn nor did they have a single god they went out to blockade all the citadels ah uuila and ah chulimal zaqui ya and xahbaquieh chi temah and vahxalahuh along with ah cabracan chabi cac and chi hunahpu with ah maca and ah xay abah ah zaccabaha and ah ziyaha ah miquina and ah xelahuh these went forth as war sentinels to the plains and to the mountains they were guardians of the earth they were sent out by quicab and cauizimah the ah pop and the ah pop of the reception house as well as by the magistrate and the herald four lords sent them out to act as sentinels against the warriors quicab and cauizimah were the names of the two lords over the cavecs quema was the name of the lord over the nihaibs achac iboy then was the name of the lord over the ahau quich s these then were the names of the lords that sent out messengers and envoys they left their vassals and their servants on the mountains on each one of the mountains and soon after they left they began to bring back female captives and male captives who were presented before quicab cauizimah the magistrate and the herald they made war with the notch of the arrow and the center of the bowstring taking female captives and male captives these envoys came to be warlike then thus they were given gifts they were increased the lords provided for them when they came to deliver all of their female captives and male captives thus the lords ah pop ah pop of the reception house magistrate and herald gathered their thoughts then they made a proclamation we shall ennoble they who are truly first among these lineages who have carried the burden of being watchmen i am the ah pop i am the ah pop of the reception house the emblems of office of the ah pop shall now become yours you shall be adorned as lord magistrates and as magistrates said all the lords when they gathered their thoughts the tamub and the ilocab did the same the three groups of the quich s were united thus they ennobled them giving them their titles this then was their consensus but it was not there that they ennobled them there was a designated mountain on which the first vassals and servants were ennobled thus all of them were summoned from each of their mountains they gathered together as one the names of the mountain where they were ennobled were xe balax and xe camac this was the edict that was given there at chulimal it was done the titles given to those who were ennobled these then were their titles their nobility and the tokens of their office twenty magistrates and twenty ah pops who were raised to nobility by the ah pop and the ah pop of the reception house as well as by the magistrate and the herald thus all of the magistrates and ah pops received their offices eleven great stewards magistrates of the lords magistrates of the zaquics military magistrates military ah pops military palisade masters and military border masters these were the titles of the men who were elevated in rank they were also named to their seats and to their cushions these were the first among the vassals and servants of the quich people they were their watchers and their listeners the notch of the arrow and the center of the bowstring they encircled the quich s as their stockade their enclosure their fortress and their palisade the tamub and the ilocab did likewise they also ennobled and gave titles to the first among their vassals and their servants on each of the mountains this therefore was the foundation for the magistrates and ah pops who are assigned to each of the mountains today this is also the order in which they go out behind the ah pop and ah pop of the reception house and behind the magistrate and herald the names of the gods houses we shall now tell the names of the houses of the gods these houses were simply named after the gods themselves great temple of tohil was the name of the temple that served as the house of tohil of the cavecs figure 90 temple of tohil at cumarcah drawing from rivera y maestre atlas guatemalteco ca 1834 auilix was the name of the temple that served as the house of auilix of the nihaibs figure 91 ruins of the temple of auilix at cumarcah and hacavitz was the name of the temple that served as the house of the god of the ahau quich s figure 92 ruins of the temple of hacavitz at cumarcah maize flower house may surely be seen sacrifice house is its other name these were great temples wherein were the stone gods there all the lords of the quich s worshiped all the nations worshiped there as well the nations would enter therein to burn offerings before tohil first then they would worship the ah pop and ah pop of the reception house they would come to give their quetzal feathers and their tribute before the lords each in turn they would give provisions and sustenance to the ah pop and the ah pop of the reception house the great lords who had brought down their citadels cucumatz and co tuha were enchanted people and enchanted lords quicab and cauizimah were also enchanted lords they knew if there would be war it was clear before their faces they saw if there would be death if there would be hunger they surely knew if there would be strife there was an instrument of sight there was a book popol vuh was their name for it but it was not only because of this that they were lords they were great in their essence great as well were their fasts in order to venerate their temples and venerate their sovereignty they fasted for long periods of time and sacrificed before the faces of their gods and this was their method of fasting for nine score days they would fast and for nine they would sacrifice and burn offerings then for thirteen score days they would observe a fast and for thirteen they would sacrifice and burn offerings before the face of tohil as well as before the faces of the other gods they would eat only zapotes matasanos and jocotes they would not eat food made from maize if they were to sacrifice for seventeen score days then they would fast for seventeen nor did they eat maize truly great was the performance of their sacred obligations this was the sign of their essence neither would they sleep with their women they would merely provide for each other fasting in the houses of the gods each day they would merely worship merely burn offerings and merely offer sacrifices they were there in the darkness and at dawn weeping in their hearts and in their bowels pleading for the light and the lives of their vassals and servants they would lift up their faces to the sky for their lordship this then is their pleading before the faces of their gods this is the crying out of their hearts the prayer of the lords to their gods yea pleasing is the day you huracan and you heart of sky and earth you who give abundance and new life and you who give daughters and sons be at peace scatter your abundance and new life may life and creation be given may my daughters and my sons be multiplied and created that they may provide for you sustain you and call upon you on the roads on the cleared pathways along the courses of the rivers in the canyons beneath the trees and the bushes give then their daughters and their sons may there be no fault confinement shame or misfortune may no deceiver come behind them or before them may they not fall or be wounded may they not be dishonored or condemned may they not fall below the road or above the road may they not be stricken or have impediments placed behind them or before them may you place them on green roads and on green pathways may they not be blamed or confined do not hide yourselves from them nor curse them may their existence be favored so that they may be providers and sustainers to you to your mouths and to your faces you heart of sky and you heart of earth you bundled glory and you as well tohil auilix and hacavitz womb of sky and womb of earth the four sides and the four corners may there be only light only security within your mouths and before your faces o gods thus it was that the lords fasted during the nine score days the thirteen score days and the seventeen score days as well they fasted often crying out in their hearts on behalf of their vassals and servants as well as on behalf of all their women and children thus each of the lords carried out his obligations this was their way of showing veneration for their lordship this was the lordship of the ah pop the ah pop of the reception house the magistrate and the herald they would go in two by two in succession to bear responsibility for the nations and all the quich people in unity went forth the foundation of their word and the foundation of their provision and sustenance the root of the word went forth as well from the tamub and the ilocab along with that of the rabinals and the cakchiquels the ah tziquinahas the tuhalahas and the uchabahas in unity they would go forth to bear the burden of the quich s for this was done for all they did not merely exercise their lordship they did not merely receive gifts nor were they merely provided for or sustained nor did they merely receive food and drink all this was not without purpose they did not achieve their lordship their glory or their sovereignty by deception or theft they did not merely crush the canyons and the citadels of the small nations and the great nations great was the price that the nations gave in return they sent jade and precious metal the
